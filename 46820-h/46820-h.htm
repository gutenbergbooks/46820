</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_6 c005'     >The subject of the following
experiments, has excited such
general curiosity, that every new
fact respecting it, may afford some
gratification; and although the few
which I have to offer, have not
led me to what many may think
very important conclusions, they
will not I hope be found wholly
undeserving of attention. The experiments
were begun, with the
view of ascertaining if the influence
discovered by M. Galvani, be
referrible to any known law of nature,
or if it be itself a new law.</p>

<p class='c006' >Finding that it indicated, with
tolerable accuracy, the presence of
very small degrees of the contractile
power of muscles, without appearing
in the least to diminish
that power, as electricity and most
other stimuli never fail to do; I
thought it might be used with advantage,
as a test, in the investigation
of some important subjects
in physiology; and I have accordingly
employed it as such.</p>

<p class='c006' >Every circumstance, observed in
the course of these experiments,
was carefully noted down, at the
instant it occurred, and the greater
number of these was made in the
presence of gentlemen, whose accuracy
I had reason to hope would
detect any fallacy, which might
have escaped myself. I have a particular
pleasure, in expressing my
obligation to Mr George Hunter of
York, for the very friendly assistance
which he afforded me, in
almost every experiment, which
rendered such assistance necessary.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>SECTION I.<br /> <br /><i>Are the Phenomena, exhibited by the Application<br />of certain different Metals<br />to Animals, referrible to Electricity?</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_6 c005'     >The whole train of circumstances, which
preceded this discovery, had a tendency
to occasion the belief of its relation
to electricity.</p>

<p class='c006' >Some accidental appearances, certainly electrical,
excited, by their novelty, the attention
of the Professor of Anatomy at Bologna,
to the investigation of the possible,
but unknown, dependencies of the motions
of animals upon electricity; and the astonishing
effects of that influence upon the
human body, particularly in paralytic diseases,
whether owing to derangements of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_2' id='Page_2'>2</a></span>
the nerves, or of the muscles; the experiments,
which prove that the fluids of animals
are better conductors of electricity,
than water is; and that, “if an electric
shock pass through a given part of a living
animal, the same shock, after the animal
is dead, will be visibly transmitted
over the surface of the part, but not through
it<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a>:” the recollection, too, of that singular
power, which some animals possess, as the
<i>torpedo</i>, the <i>gymnotus electricus</i>, and the <i>silurus
electricus</i>, of collecting and discharging at
pleasure the electrical fluid; but, above all,
the wonderful, but solitary, instance of an
electrical shock received from a mouse, under
dissection, recently related by his countryman
Cotugno; were circumstances, which
seem to have rendered the expectations of
the Professor not a little sanguine as to his
success.</p>

<p class='c006' >At length, after many ingenious and interesting
experiments, illustrative of the relations
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_3' id='Page_3'>3</a></span>
which subsist between artificial electricity
and the involuntary motions of animals,
a happy accident discovered to him
the phenomena, which have since been the
objects of so much curious research, and
which have given to immortality the name
of <em>Galvani</em>.</p>

<p class='c006' >He one day observed, that some frogs,
hooked by the spine of the back, and suspended
from the iron palisades, which surrounded
his garden, contracted frequently
and involuntarily. Examining minutely into
the cause of these contractions, he found
that he could produce them at pleasure, by
touching the animals with two different metals,
at the same time in contact with each
other.</p>

<p class='c006' >To a mind prepared by such observations
and experiments as those which had previously
occupied M. Galvani, the resemblance
which this new discovery bore to the facts
he had before observed, must have produced
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_4' id='Page_4'>4</a></span>
conviction of the identity of their cause;
and the experiments, which have since been
made both by himself, and Dr Valli, have
given no small degree of plausibility to the
opinion. A repetition of some of these experiments
excited my doubts as to the legitimacy
of the conclusions which had been
drawn from them, and induced me at length
to proceed in the following investigation.</p>

<p class='c006' >My first object was to ascertain as well
the various circumstances, which are essentially
requisite to the production of these
new phenomena, as those in which they
can be rendered most obvious. After a great
variety of experiments, of which it would
be unnecessary here to relate more than the
result, I found that I could not excite in an
animal the appearances described by Galvani
with any substances whatever, whether solid
or fluid, except the metals: and that the
mutual contact of two different metals with
each other, so far as I was able to determine,
was in every case necessary to the effect.</p>

<p class='c006' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_5' id='Page_5'>5</a></span>
When metals are either calcined, or combined
with acids, they are no longer capable
of exciting contraction. In estimating the
comparative powers of different metals as
excitors, I found zinc<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a> by far the most efficacious,
especially when in contact with
gold, silver, molybdena, steel, or copper, although
these latter excite but feeble contractions
when in contact only with each other.
Next to zinc, tin foil, and lead appear to
be the best excitors. But with zinc, and
gold, silver, or molybdena, I have frequently
succeeded in exciting contractions in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_6' id='Page_6'>6</a></span>
foot of a frog, upwards of a day after they
had ceased to be excited, by arming the nerve
with tin foil, and using some other metal as
a conductor, in the way the experiment is
commonly performed.</p>

<p class='c006' >When the bulk of the metals is large, and
the quantity of surface, of an animal with
which they are in contact, is considerable, I
think, the contractions are both stronger
and more readily excited, than when the reverse
of this is the case. Thus I have almost
always been able to make a limb contract,
by laying it upon a broad plate of
zinc, and employing a half crown piece for
an excitor, long after a small piece of zinc,
and a silver probe, had failed to produce
any effect.</p>

<p class='c006' >I have said, that, in order to excite contractions,
I believe it necessary that two
different metals, communicating with the
part to be excited, should be in contact with
each other. Some few instances have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_7' id='Page_7'>7</a></span>
observed, which seem to prove the contrary.
In a lecture, so long ago as October
last, in which Dr Baillie of London mentioned
Galvani’s discovery, I think I remember
him saying, that he had twice or
thrice produced contractions by the application
of one metal only: and Dr Valli, in
his 9th letter upon this subject, speaks of
his having done the same with a pair of
scissars, made of bad steel, and in a frog recently
killed. I think it not impossible
that there may have been some unnoticed
fallacy in these instances. I happened one
day to touch the crural nerve of a frog, with
a small gold tooth-pick slid from a silver
case, and the leg instantly contracted; I
again touched it, and it again contracted.
At another time I observed contractions
from touching a nerve, with a silver
cannula, and at another from placing one in
the folds of a silver chain. All these appeared
at the time to be so many decisive
instances of contractions from the application
of one metal, till the following experiment
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_8' id='Page_8'>8</a></span>
seemed to afford a different explanation.
Having placed, one end of a silver
probe upon the sciatic nerve of a frog, lying
in water some inches below the surface, I
observed that no contractions followed,
neither did they, when I touched the part
of the probe above the surface with a piece
of zinc. But when I touched it at the surface,
so that both the zinc and the silver
were in contact with the water, although
the zinc was at the same time many inches
removed from the frog, contractions were
produced equally vigorous, as if both the
metals had been in immediate contact with
the frog.</p>

<p class='c006' >I was now no longer at a loss to account
for the contractions produced by the gold
tooth pick, since the circumstances both of
that case, and of the experiment related,
were probably the same, two metals in contact
with each other. The gold in immediate
contact with a nerve; and the silver
case communicating with it, and the muscles
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_9' id='Page_9'>9</a></span>
through the medium of the moisture, with
which the whole was perhaps surrounded.
This led me to examine the chain, and the
cannula. I found both the links of the
one, and the sides of the other, soldered
with a different metal<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c008'><sup>[3]</sup></a>. So that, in these
cases, two metals had at the same time
been in contact with a nerve, with moisture,
and with each other.</p>

<p class='c006' >However this may be with respect to
the necessity of mutual contact, between
two different metals in order to excite contractions,
I have long ago found, that contractions
may be excited in an animal,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>10</a></span>
when no more than one metal is in contact
with it<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c008'><sup>[4]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006' >At the time I first observed this fact,
I was making experiments to ascertain whether
it was possible to transmit the influence,
which had excited contractions in one leg,
into another, removed to some distance
from it, and communicating with it, only
by means of a single conducting substance,
(such as silver, for example). For this
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_11' id='Page_11'>11</a></span>
purpose, I had separated from the trunk,
and from each other, the hind legs of a
frog recently killed, and had detached their
nerves as far as the knee. I then laid them
at some distance from each other, upon a
plate of glass, and included the nerve of
one leg, and the foot of the other, in the
folded ends of a silver chain. With one
hand I now raised from the muscles, upon
the end of a silver probe, the nerve of the
leg, whose foot was folded in the chain;
and with a piece of zinc, in the other hand,
touched, at the same time, the nerve and
the probe. This leg was thrown into
strong contractions; but none were excited
in the other. I then touched the chain,
and nerve of the other, and, to my surprise,
both legs instantly contracted. I had observed,
in the beginning of November last,
that it was not necessary for the metals to be
in contact with any thing but nerve, in order
to excite contractions in the muscles,
to which it was distributed; and had mentioned
this fact immediately afterwards to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_12' id='Page_12'>12</a></span>
the Medical Society of this place, as a sufficient
refutation of the theory, which Dr
Valli had formed of Galvani’s discovery. It
would not, therefore, have surpassed my expectations,
had the influence, excited by the
mutual contact of a piece of zinc, and probe,
with the nerve, passed through the medium
of the chain, from the leg, in which it first
excited contractions, and produced contractions
in the distant leg. But, I now thought
that I had not only passed the influence
from one leg to the other, but in one of
the legs in a direction contrary to the
course of its nerves. The removal of the
leg, whose nerve communicated with the
chain, convinced me of my error: but, at
the same time, discovered to me a fact of
much greater importance, than any with
which I had hitherto been acquainted. For
now, upon touching the chain alone with the
zinc, I found that the leg, whose foot it still
included, and whose nerve I held suspended
upon a probe, contracted as strongly as
before. The influence of the two metals,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'>13</a></span>
in contact with the nerve of the other leg,
had not, therefore, passed into, and excited
this.</p>

<p class='c006' >It had from the first been known, that
contractions could be excited by placing
two different metals in contact, one
with the nerve, the other with the muscles,
and making a communication between
them: but, in this experiment, the only metal
in contact, either with the nerve, or
muscle, was silver. Neither had the influence
passed through the chain, and up
the leg against the course of the nerve, in
consequence of a communication by means
of moisture subsisting between the zinc, and
the foot, as well as between the silver chain,
and the foot; for the experiment succeeded
equally well when the chain was removed,
and the foot laid upon a silver plate made
perfectly dry. But when either the zinc,
or probe was held by another person not
communicating with me; or when either
of them was insulated in a stick of sealing
wax; no contraction whatever took place.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>14</a></span>
Neither, indeed, were contractions excited
in any part of the leg, except the foot,
when the probe was withdrawn from the
nerve; and the foot, and silver, were both
touched with the zinc. It is then clear, that
the influence, which, in the former case,
excited the whole leg to contraction, must
have passed through the medium of my
body. It is not necessary that the silver
should be laid under the foot; all that is required,
is, that it should communicate with
it by means of moisture; it may then be
laid at almost any distance from it<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c008'><sup>[5]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006' >The course of this influence, however,
was still undetermined: it might be from
the muscles to the nerve: it might be from
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>15</a></span>
the nerve to the muscles. To ascertain this,
and to prove that the influence, which had
excited one limb to contraction, might pass
on, through a foreign medium, and excite
contractions in another, I made the following
experiment.</p>

<p class='c006' >The leg of a frog was disposed as in the
former experiment. The probe, suspending
the nerve, was held by myself; the zinc excitor
by another person; and the leg of another
frog formed the communication betwixt
us. So long as I had hold of the nerve,
and the person assisting me held the foot of
this interposed leg, no contractions were excited
in it, by the influence, which passed
through it and excited the other leg. But
when the person holding the zinc, held the
nerve of the interposed leg; and I held the
foot, both legs contracted with equal strength.
From this experiment it is evident, that
Galvani’s influence had passed either from
the muscles, or the zinc and silver; and in
the direct course of the nerves of both legs.</p>

<p class='c006' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'>16</a></span>
I was now in possession of an easy method
of ascertaining the different substances, which
do, or which do not, afford a passage to this
new influence.</p>

<p class='c006' >All the metals when pure appear to be
excellent conductors; not quite so good
when in the ore; and, I think, least so
when combined with acids, forming metallic
salts. They are however, in this state, by
no means bad conductors, even when so
carefully dried, as to leave no suspicion of
the slightest degree of moisture adhering to
their surface. But, when the metals are calcined,
their capacity as conductors is quite
destroyed: at least this was the case with
the calces of zinc, of bismuth, of iron, and
of mercury; the only ones, with which I
have had an opportunity of making the experiment.
I could not observe that any
contractions were excited through the medium
of stones, nor ever through barytes.</p>

<p class='c006' >The different non-conductors of electricity
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>17</a></span>
are likewise, I find non-conductors of
this influence: even wood, charcoal, and
linen, do not conduct except when moist.
But all the living vegetables I could procure
afforded it a ready passage: probably from
the fluids which they contain. While I
held the probe which supported the nerve,
I touched the shoe of a gentleman, who applied
the zinc to the silver under the foot
of the frog. Strong contractions were excited,
but when he took off his shoe, and
we held it between our hands, no contractions
could be excited. In the first case, the
influence had to pass through no more than
the thickness of the shoe: in the second,
through its whole length, which might not
be all equally moist. This gentleman had on
thread stockings. When I touched the foot
of another, who had on cotton stockings,
no contractions were excited. Cotton is a
non-conductor of electricity.</p>

<p class='c006' >Oils of all kinds are so far from conducting,
that if the fingers of the person holding
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'>18</a></span>
either the probe, or the zinc, have perspired
much, even this operates as a complete
obstruction to the passage of the influence:
the instant the perspired matter has
been wiped away, and the fingers have
been dipped in water, it again passes, and
excites contractions. When the intestines
of a frog are removed, and its abdomen is
filled with oil, no contraction can be excited
by placing one metal upon its sciatic
nerves, and bringing another in contact with
it, either above or below the surface of the
oil.</p>

<p class='c006' >There is something singular in this respect,
with regard to mercury. If the abdomen
of a frog be filled with it, a piece of
zinc passed through it, so as to touch the
sciatic nerves, excites contractions. But a
piece of silver, passed to them, excites none.
Neither are any excited by touching the
silver, beneath the surface of the mercury,
with a piece of zinc. But I have before
shewn, that, when water is used instead of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>19</a></span>
mercury, contractions may be in this way
excited; yet mercury is reckoned a much
better conductor of electricity than water.
I have repeatedly passed this influence
through a great length of thin brass wire, and
through the bodies of five persons communicating
with each other, by dipping their
fingers in basins of water placed between
them; yet it did not appear to have lost any
of its force, in this long and diffused passage:
for the contractions excited in the
frog’s leg were equally strong, as when it
had passed only through one person. Vitriolic
acid, and alcohol appear still better
conductors than water.</p>

<p class='c006' >Wishing to ascertain whether it passed
over the surface, or through the substance
of metals, I coated several rods of different
metals with sealing wax, leaving nothing
but their ends, by which they were held,
uncovered. Contractions were excited as
readily through the media of these, as if
they had not been coated. It seems to meet
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>20</a></span>
with no obstruction in passing from link
to link, of several chains, even when no
pressure, except that of their own weight,
is used to bring them into contact. I was
led from this to hope, that I should be able
to make it pass through a very thin plate of
air. I, therefore, coated a stick of sealing
wax, with a plate of tin-foil, and then made
an almost imperceptible division a-cross it
with a sharp pen-knife. But even this interruption
of continuity in the conductor
was sufficient effectually to bar its passage.</p>

<p class='c006' >The chains, through which it passed most
readily, were of gold and silver. It did not
pass through a very long and fine brass
chain, unless as much force as could be
used, without breaking the chain, was employed
to bring its links into close contact.</p>

<p class='c006' >I next proceeded to examine if the capacity
of different substances, as conductors,
or non-conductors, was at all affected by
differences of their temperature. But this
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span>
was not the case with zinc, iron, water, coal,
or a common crucible, the only substances
with which I tried the experiment. A red
hot iron, and boiling water, conducted
equally as well as iron and water that had
not been heated: and neither the crucible,
nor the coal, became conductors from any
addition of heat.</p>

<p class='c006' >I at first thought that ice conducted; but
as, on some trials, no contractions were excited
through its medium; and as it appeared
uniformly to conduct ill in proportion
to the dryness of its surface; I suspect that,
if perfectly dry, it would not conduct at
all. The instant a part of its surface had
been dissolved by the heat of the room,
contractions were excited with as much
ease, as they usually are through a bason of
water. It would appear, therefore, that
neither very hot, nor very cold water disperse
this influence, as has been asserted by
Dr Valli, nor do they seem in the least degree
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_22' id='Page_22'>22</a></span>
to diminish its power of producing
contractions<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c008'><sup>[6]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006' >It appears upon the whole to be necessary,
that this influence should pass to a
part in a very condensed state, in order to
excite contractions: although there are some
facts, which, without reflecting, might lead
one to suppose, that, passing even in a diffused
state, it would excite them. In making
that experiment, in which the piece of
zinc under the foot of a frog is touched with
zinc, while its crural nerve is supported by
a silver probe; no contraction takes place,
if the probe be either lowered, so as to
come in contact with the muscles of the
thigh, or if it be made to touch the silver
under the foot.</p>

<p class='c006' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'>23</a></span>
If again, two persons, one of whom holds
the probe, the other the zinc, communicate
with each other by dipping their unemployed
hands in a bason of water; and the person
using the zinc holds another leg of a
frog, suspended between his fingers by its
nerve beneath the surface of the water; no
contraction will take place in this leg, when
the silver under the other is touched with
zinc, at the same time that strong ones are
excited in that other. But, if its nerve be
raised above the surface of the water, it then
contracts as vividly as the other. It appears
that in the last of these instances, at least the
greater part of the influence had diffused
itself through the water, instead of passing
directly through the nerve, from the fingers
of the person holding it, and that in
both it had passed into the legs, in too diffused
a state to excite them to contraction.</p>

<p class='c006' >I have often likewise observed, that when
the nerve of a nearly exhausted leg of a frog
had been laid upon a piece of zinc, and both
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'>24</a></span>
were touched with silver, the contractions
excited were very distinct: but when the
zinc was placed in contact with the muscle,
as well as with the nerve, either no contractions
could be excited, or such feeble
ones that they were scarcely perceptible.</p>

<p class='c006' >Contractions, however, certainly may be
excited in different parts of a frog, without
making any division of its skin, by laying
the part of the frog to be excited upon a
plate of zinc, or tin-foil, and passing a piece
of silver over it, till all three are in contact
with each other<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c008'><sup>[7]</sup></a>. Yet even here the influence
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>25</a></span>
does not pass into the part in so
diffused a state as it may at first appear to
do. For the skin of these animals is abundantly
supplied with nerves, whose trunks
communicate, at different places, with those
which supply the muscles. And the contractions
are always strongest, and most readily
excited, when the silver is passed over the
course of any of the nerves, which go to
the muscles.</p>

<p class='c006' >From the fact, which I have before mentioned,
that a limb may be made to contract,
when the metals have apparently no
communication with any part of it except
its nerve; it might reasonably be doubted,
whether, in any case, a communication between
the muscles, as well as the nerve,
and the metals, were necessary, in order that
contractions may be excited.</p>

<p class='c006' >Several considerations, however, induce
me to believe, that such communication is
absolutely requisite. If the contact of two
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>26</a></span>
different metals were alone sufficient to excite
contractions; contractions should always
take place, whenever a good conductor
is interposed between the metals, and
the nerve alone. But I have, in no instance,
observed this to be the case. In the experiment,
where the crural nerve must be
supported upon a silver probe, it is necessary
that the piece of silver, with which the
zinc is brought in contact, should communicate
either immediately, or through some
good conducting medium, with the muscles
of the foot, or leg, before any contraction
takes place. And even in the experiment,
where water forms the only communication
between the metals, and the origin of the
sciatic nerves, that same water, it must be
observed, forms likewise a communication
between the metals and the muscles, to
which these nerves are distributed. But the
fact, which appears to me most decisive of
this question, is the following: When a
nerve, which for some time has been detached
from surrounding parts, is either
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'>27</a></span>
carefully wiped quite dry with a piece of
fine muslin, or (lest this should be thought
to injure its structure,) suffered to remain
suspended till its moisture has evaporated;
no contractions can be excited in the
muscles, to which it is distributed, by touching
it alone with any two metals in contact
with each other. But, if it be again moistened
with a few drops of water, contractions
instantly take place: and, in this way,
by alternately drying and moistening the
nerve, contractions may, at pleasure, be alternately
suspended and renewed for a considerable
time. It may, indeed, be contended,
that the moisture softened, and thus
restored electricity and free expansion to
the dried cellular membrane surrounding
the fibres, of which the trunk of a nerve is
composed; and thus, by removing constraint,
gave free play to their organization<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c008'><sup>[8]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>28</a></span>
But from observing, that, in every other
instance, where contractions are produced
by the mutual contact of the metals, a conducting
substance is interposed between
them and the muscles, as well as between
them and the nerve; I think it would be
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>29</a></span>
unphilosophical not to allow, that, in the
instance in question, the moisture, adhering
to the surface of the nerve, formed that requisite
communication between the metals
and the muscles.</p>

<p class='c006' >I relate the following fact, in this place,
because at the same time that it gives further
confirmation to the above opinion, it
affords an instance in which insulation diminished
the effect of the metals. I had one
day laid the nearly exhausted leg of a frog
upon my hand, with a piece of zinc in contact
with its nerve only; and, when I touched
these with a silver probe, tolerably strong
contractions were excited, even when the
nerve appeared dry: but when both the leg
and the metals, thus disposed, were insulated
by means of glass and sealing wax, the
contractions were scarcely perceptible. My
hand, it would appear, had, in these instances,
supplied the place of the moisture in the
other; and been the conducting medium
between the muscles and the metals.</p>

<p class='c006' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>30</a></span>
This communication of the muscles with
the nerve, through the medium of the metals,
had appeared to Dr Valli a circumstance
so essential to the production of Galvani’s
phenomena, that (taking it for granted
they were occasioned by the action of
the electrical fluid), it seems to have suggested
the hypothesis, which he has offered in
order to account for them.</p>

<p class='c006' >Aware that no electrical phenomenon can
possibly have place, except between the opposite
states of positive and negative electricity,
or, in other words, where there is a
breach of equilibrium in the distribution of
the electrical fluid; he supposes it to be one
office of the nerves, to produce this breach
of equilibrium, by continually pumping (to
use his own expression) the electrical fluid
from the internal parts of muscles, and in
this way rendering them negative, with respect
to the external surface. The brain, he
makes the common receptacle for this fluid.
The metals, he seems to consider in the light
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span>
of a conductor, interposed between the outside
of muscles and their nerves. And the
rapid transmission of the fluid to restore the
equilibrium, as the cause of the contractions.</p>

<p class='c006' >He presumes his hypothesis proved from
the following considerations:</p>

<p class='c006' >I. The interval which commonly takes
place between the contractions; which interval,
according to him, is necessary for the
restoration of the breach of equilibrium.</p>

<p class='c006' >II. From observing, that fishermen, in order
to preserve their fish from putridity,
crush their brains; and thus, by interrupting
the medium between the external and internal
surfaces of muscles, prevent these repeated
discharges of the electrical fluid,
which, according to Dr Valli, hastens their
putridity.</p>

<p class='c006' >III. From finding that in general, when
the sciatic nerve on one side of a living frog
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>32</a></span>
was divided, the other being left entire,
communicating with the brain, both armed
and equally excited, the limb, in which the
nerve had been divided, preserved its power
of contracting longer than the other.
From this well devised experiment, he concludes,
likewise, that animal electricity is the
principle of life. That, on the side where
the nerve remained entire, it was withdrawn
from the muscles, and deposited in the brain.
That, from the impossibility of this taking
place on the other side, where the nerve was
divided, it had continued in the limb, and
enabled it to contract.</p>

<p class='c006' >If it were indisputably true, as I once believed,
that contractions could be excited
in a limb without the metals having any
communication with it, except through the
medium of a nerve; this circumstance
would alone be a sufficient refutation of Dr
Valli’s hypothesis: but, as I have already
shewn, that contractions were not in this
way produced in any experiment, which I
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>33</a></span>
have made, when no moisture, forming a
communication between the metals and the
muscles, had been left adhering to the surface
of the nerve, it becomes necessary to
have recourse to less dubious arguments.</p>

<p class='c006' >The Dr should have recollected that, in
cases of a breach of equilibrium in the distribution
of the electrical fluid, all that is
required, in order to restore equality of distribution,
is, the interposition of a single
conducting substance between the place in
which it abounds, and that in which there
is a deficiency. Whereas, in the phenomena,
which he attempts to explain, two
conducting substances are necessary to the
effect.</p>

<p class='c006' >When a separated limb is placed under
water, one would naturally imagine, that
from the perfect communication, which is
then formed between the external surfaces of
muscles and their nerves, no breach of equilibrium
could possibly have place: yet we
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>34</a></span>
find Galvani’s phenomena even more readily
produced in this situation, than when
both muscles and nerves are free from surrounding
moisture.</p>

<p class='c006' >The following experiment was made
with a view of rendering the equilibrium
of the electrical fluid, in different parts of
frogs, as perfect as possible.</p>

<p class='c006' >The head of a frog having been separated
from its body, the latter was laid upon
a plate of zinc, held by a person sitting in
an insulated chair, which communicated
with the prime conductor of an electrical
machine. The machine was put in action,
and both the person and the frog were electrified
positively. In these circumstances,
no sparks could be drawn from the frog,
by the person holding it: nor could any
other electrical appearance take place between
them. But, when a piece of silver
was passed over different parts of the frog,
and, at the same time, brought into contact
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'>35</a></span>
with the zinc plate, contractions were uniformly
excited, differing not in the least,
either in strength or frequency, from those
which are excited when no artificial electricity
is present. The result was precisely
the same, when the frog and the person
holding it were negatively electrified. This
experiment was often repeated. The following
experiment was made, in order to
see if the effect produced upon a frog, by
the passage of artificial electricity from any
part of its body, would be increased by
employing two different metals as conductors.</p>

<p class='c006' >A frog was laid, successively, upon a
number of different metals, insulated upon
glass, and positively electrified by communicating
with the prime conductor of an
electrical machine. The contractions produced
in the frog, thus disposed, by drawing
sparks from it, with metals different
from those on which it was placed, were
not in the least stronger, than those occasioned
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'>36</a></span>
by drawing similar sparks from it,
with conductors of the same metal.</p>

<p class='c006' >In establishing a communication between
two opposite electricities, as, for example,
between the two sides of a charged phial,
it is matter of indifference to which the
conductor is first applied. But it is by no
means so, in the case of muscles and armed
nerves. For, if one branch of a conductor
be applied to the tin-foil arming a nerve,
before the other branch has been applied to
the muscles, it frequently fails to excite
contractions. If first applied to the muscles,
this is very seldom the case.</p>

<p class='c006' >As for the intervals of rest which alternate
with the contractions, and which the
Dr considers as employed by the nerves,
in restoring the breach of equilibrium between
the internal surfaces of muscles, and
their external; these may possibly admit
of a different explanation.</p>

<p class='c006' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'>37</a></span>
We find them alternating with contractions
however excited. It is difficult to
conceive, that violent contractions should
not derange in some degree, however slight,
the intimate organization of muscular fibres:
and some time must necessarily elapse before
their elasticity can have restored the
organized particles, of which they are composed,
to that relative situation with respect
to each other, which will fit them for again
contracting.</p>

<p class='c006' >This explanation is drawn from observing
the following facts. Hearts, taken from
the living thorax, and exposed to the action
of a strong stimulus, contract vividly
for a time, and then cease to be effected by
any further application. If they be then
removed from the stimulus, and placed for
a time either in cold water or in open air,
they are observed to regain their susceptibility
of the action of stimuli, and again
contract. Mr Coleman, in his excellent dissertation
on Suspended Respiration, makes
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>38</a></span>
an observation, which I have often had opportunity
of verifying: that hearts distended
with blood, and in which no contraction
can be produced, by scratching their surface
with a pointed instrument, contract spontaneously,
if one of the large vessels, at some
distance from them, be cut so as to evacuate
some of the blood.</p>

<p class='c006' >The organization, in this case, is suffered
to recover by the removal of the stimulus,
(distention) which had deranged it. Even,
in the living and entire animal, the heart
does not renew its contractions, on the first
influx of blood. Some time must elapse,
while it recovers from the derangement occasioned
by the preceding contraction.</p>

<p class='c006' >I have repeatedly excited, by means of
zinc and silver, contractions in the leg of a
frog, whose head had been divided from its
body, upwards of three days before. The
receptacle, for the electrical fluid, was in
these cases removed. Now, either the nerves
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>39</a></span>
continued extracting it from the internal
parts of muscles, or they did not. If they
did, having no longer a receptacle, in which
they could deposite their electricity, they
must have remained positively electrified;
and thus, being in the same state with the
outer surface of the muscles, no contraction
should, according to the hypothesis, have
been excited by the application of the metals.
But this is contrary to the fact.</p>

<p class='c006' >If it be contended, on the other hand,
that their pumping power had ceased; then
the first application of the metals, which
produced a contraction, having restored the
equilibrium, which could not afterwards be
broken, must have precluded the possibility
of further contractions. But this too is contrary
to fact.</p>

<p class='c006' >This argument appears, to me, to do away
all support, which the hypothesis may
seem to derive from the experiment, before
quoted, of applying the metals equally to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span>
both sciatic nerves, after one of them had
been divided; I may however remark, that
the pain necessarily excited by arming a nerve,
whose communication with the brain was
not interrupted, would fully account for
the more rapid exhaustion of the muscles,
to which it belonged, compared with such
as had not been acted upon by so strong
an additional stimulus. As fact, however,
is always more satisfactory than argument,
I shall relate the following accidental experiment,
in proof of the relevancy of the
foregoing observation.</p>

<p class='c006' >Four days after I had divided the crural
nerve of a female frog, full of spawn, I
found her dead; she had been observed alive
the night before. The application of
the metals to the leg, whose nerve had not
been divided, did not excite the slightest
contractions, but on applying them to the
leg, in which the nerve had been divided,
tolerably strong contractions were excitable,
for more than twelve hours after she was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>41</a></span>
found. The spawning season had closed,
upwards of a week before this happened,
and, as this frog had long been without a
male to assist her, it is probable, that her
death had been occasioned by the retention
of her spawn, as it was found in a very
dissolved state. The pain, necessarily preceding
such a death, could affect the different
parts of the animal, only through the
medium of its nerves; and hence the exemption
of that part from its effects, to
which the communication, by nerve, had
been interrupted.</p>

<p class='c006' >The same observation will apply to that
argument, which Dr Valli has drawn, in
support of his hypothesis, from the practice
of fishermen. By destroying the brain,
they take away all sense of pain, and, consequently,
preclude that exhaustion which
is so notorious for disposing to putridity.</p>

<p class='c006' >Should it, therefore, be ever proved, that
the phenomena discovered by Galvani are
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span>
effects of the action of electricity, I cannot
think Dr Valli’s hypothesis will be deemed
a satisfactory account of the manner in
which it produces them.</p>

<p class='c006' >Strong, however, as is the analogy, which,
in many particulars this influence bears to
electricity, considerable doubts must, I think,
still remain as to their identity.</p>

<p class='c006' >The grounds of these doubts would best
appear in an accurate and full statement of
the several points, both of resemblance and
of difference between this influence, electricity,
and that power which distinguishes
the torpedo, the gymnotus, and the silurus;
but, I can here promise no more than a
very imperfect and desultory sketch of
these.</p>

<p class='c006' >In order to accumulate artificial electricity,
if I may be allowed the use of such
an expression, it seems necessary, that there
should be motion between two substances,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_43' id='Page_43'>43</a></span>
an electric and a conductor. But, neither
motion nor electrics have any share in the
production of that influence which occasions
the phenomena in question. The
motion, here, is the effect, and not the
cause of the accumulation: and instead of
one conducting substance of any kind whatever,
two metallic substances seem indispensably
requisite<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c008'><sup>[9]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_44' id='Page_44'>44</a></span>
That influence, whatever it be, which is
possessed by the torpedo, &amp;c. seems to depend
entirely upon the will of these animals,
both for its production, and management,
as appears not only from the retraction
of their eyes within their sockets,
whenever they mean to give a shock, but,
likewise, from each shock being increased,
diminished, or withheld, as they are irritated
or aware of some obstacle to its transmission.
But the will of an animal has no
share in the production of the phenomena
discovered by Galvani.</p>

<p class='c006' >In the scale of conductors of electricity,
charcoal holds a higher place than the fluids
of animal bodies, and ice than the metallic
salts. But of the influence in question, I
have found animal fluids, and metallic salts,
excellent conductors, at the same time that
I have never observed it pass through charcoal,
or even dried wood. I have, likewise,
reason to believe that it does not pass
through ice. Ice, indeed, is but a very imperfect
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'>45</a></span>
conductor of electricity, when free
from air bubbles, and when the experiments
with it are made in a very low degree of
temperature. Yet we are told by Mr Achard,
that it will conduct electricity, even
when Reaumur’s Thermometer stands at 6
degrees below 0.</p>

<p class='c006' >But the temperature of the room, in
which I made my experiments, was at least
55 degrees above 0, by Fahrenheit’s scale.
I may likewise remind the reader of the experiment,
in which the abdomen of a frog
was filled with mercury, and a rod of silver
passed through it to the sciatic nerves. A
piece of zinc, touching both mercury and
silver, excited no contractions; whereas
most vigorous ones were excited when water
was substituted for the mercury. A
proof, as I take it, that water is a much better
conductor of this influence than mercury:
but of electricity, mercury is deemed
a better conductor than water.</p>

<p class='c006' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>46</a></span>
We are told by Mr Cavendish, that Mr
Walsh found the shock of the torpedo
would not pass through a small brass chain:
but the influence discovered by Galvani,
passes, without sensible diminution of its effects,
through a small brass chain of several
inches in length, when it is drawn so tight
as to bring its links into close contact with
each other: and it passes through a gold
chain when held between two persons, and
suffered to hang with a considerable bend.
Yet, if we may be allowed to judge of the
comparative strength of the two influences,
by the effects which they produce upon animals,
that of the torpedo must certainly
be allowed to be the strongest; and I see no
other way of accounting for its finding an
insuperable obstacle to its transmission, where
the other finds scarcely any, except by supposing
that they are in reality different in
their nature.</p>

<p class='c006' >Dr Valli tells us, that he observed the
hairs of a mouse, attached to the nerves of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'>47</a></span>
frogs by the tin-foil, with which he surrounded
them, alternately attracted, and repelled
by each other, whenever another
metal was so applied as to excite contractions
in the frogs.</p>

<p class='c006' >This experiment I have many times repeated,
both in the manner described by the
Dr, and with every variation in the disposition
of the hairs which I could devise: but
whether they were placed upon the metals,
the nerves, or the muscles, or upon all at
the same time, neither I, nor my friends
who assisted me, have in any instance been
able to observe them agitated in the slightest
degree.</p>

<p class='c006' >I have made similar experiments upon a
dog, and upon a large and lively skate, by
disposing, in the same way that I did the
hairs of a mouse, flakes of the finest flax,
swansdown, and gold leaf; but although the
contractions produced in the skate, by the
contact of the metals, were so strong as to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'>48</a></span>
make the animal bound from the table, not
the least appearance of electricity was indicated.</p>

<p class='c006' >I next suspended, from a stick of glass fixed
in the ceiling of a close room, some threads,
five feet in length, of the flax which I used
in the former experiment; and approached
some frogs, recently killed, and insulated
upon glass as near to them as was possible,
without touching: but the threads were in nowise
affected by the contractions produced
in the frogs.</p>

<p class='c006' >In this respect, therefore, this influence
agrees with that of the torpedo, &amp;c. So far
as I know, M. Volta’s instrument for collecting,
condensing, and rendering sensible,
very small degree of electricity has not been
employed in the examination of either.</p>

<p class='c006' >And indeed I am not sure, if, in examining
the newly discovered influence, by such a
test, a sufficient quantity of electricity might
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'>49</a></span>
not be produced merely by the motion
of the animals, subjected to the experiment,
to occasion some fallacy in the result.
Certain, however, it is, that although
this influence did not affect the electrometer
in these experiments, it produces infinitely
stronger effects upon an animal, than
any which can be produced by a quantity
of electricity sufficient to affect an electrometer
to a very high degree. I have frequently
detached the crural nerves of frogs
for some length; and having supported them
upon a rod of silver, have applied an excited
piece of glass, or sealing wax, to the
whole length of this rod. The coarsest electrometers
have been effected by it, at considerable
distances: but I have never, in this
way, been able to excite contractions, unless
by laying the rod upon the excited cylender
of a powerful electrical machine.</p>

<p class='c006' >This new influence likewise resembles
that of the torpedo, in producing its effects
almost equally well, when both it and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'>50</a></span>
subject upon which it acts are insulated
from surrounding conductors. But an experiment
similar to that, which I have related,
of insulating, and positively electrifying,
both the frog and the metals applied
to it, has never (so far as I am acquainted,)
been tried with the torpedo.</p>

<p class='c006' >Both these influences agree too, in not
producing so strong an effect, when the
subject, upon which they act, is immersed
in water, as when it is in the open air.
When the separated leg of a frog was held
under water, and formed part of the circuit
through which this, to influence, had
to pass, in order to excite another leg; it
never contracted, although it did, and
strongly, when held above the surface, as
I have already had occasion to notice.
And we are told by Mr Walsh, that the
shock of the torpedo was four times stronger
in air, than when given under water.</p>

<p class='c006' >This influence differs, both from that of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'>51</a></span>
the torpedo, &amp;c. and from electricity, in
producing no sensation (in man at least,) at
all similar to that from an electrical shock.</p>

<p class='c006' >With respect to the single instance related
by M. Cotugno, it is probable that both
he himself, and all who have repeated experiments
of this nature, must have been
long ago convinced, that he was deceived
into the belief of a shock, from the sensation
produced by the struggles of the animal
he dissected.</p>

<p class='c006' >That some kind of disagreeable sensation
is occasioned by it, even in frogs, independent
of that which must necessarily arise
from irritation, and the contractions of their
muscles, is evident from their restlessness,
and expressions of uneasiness. In other
animals, as I shall afterwards have occasion
to shew, these expressions are still less
equivocal: and, in man, we can ascertain
both their degree and their kind. That
they differ considerably from such as are
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>52</a></span>
produced by electricity, will be proved
when I come to speak of the effects of this
influence upon our senses.</p>

<p class='c006' >But the most important, and characteristic
difference, which I have yet been able
to discover, between this new influence and
electricity, consists in their effects upon the
contractile power of animals and of plants.
The contractions of animals excited by electricity
have a tendency to destroy that power
upon which contractions depend. But
the contractions excited, by the application
of the metals, have, in all my experiments,
had the directly opposite effect. The more
frequently contractions have been, in this
way, excited, the longer do they continue
excitable: and the longer are the parts,
upon which such experiments are made,
preserved from putridity. An influence,
capable of exciting contractions, without occasioning
exhaustion, was a thing I so little
expected to find, and so contrary to the
character which had been given of this,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_53' id='Page_53'>53</a></span>
both by Galvani and by Dr Valli, that I,
at first, distrusted my own observation of
the fact: but the number of comparative
experiments, which I had afterwards occasion
to make, though with views different
from that of ascertaining the point in
question, convinced me that this influence,
so far from destroying the contractility of
muscles, has a tendency to preserve it. Oxygene
is, so far as I know, the only stimulus
in nature, whose effects are at all analogous.</p>

<p class='c006' >When a frog has been long dead, I have
been sometimes more than a quarter of an
hour without being able to excite a single
contraction by the application of the metals:
but after this, without at all varying
the means employed, contractions have appeared,
and have become gradually more
and more vigorous.</p>

<p class='c006' >It is said, (for I have never had an opportunity
of making the experiment,) that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_54' id='Page_54'>54</a></span>
a stream of electricity passed through a
sensitive plant produces an almost immediate
collapse of its leaves. But the influence,
discovered by Galvani, produced
no such effect in the following experiment.
Having separated the leg of a frog from
its body, I freed its crural nerve from surrounding
parts, and with one hand held it
supported upon the end of a probe. An
assistant placed a piece of silver under its
foot, and held the zinc with which it was
to be touched. A sensitive plant formed
the medium of communication between us.
He held the bottom of its stem between
his fingers, while I held the top: so that
when the silver was touched by the zinc,
the influence passed up the plant, and
through the whole of its stem. The frog’s
leg instantly contracted, and repeated its
contractions every time the silver and zinc
were in contact: but the leaves of the plant
did not collapse; neither did they when
any of its branches formed part of the circuit.</p>

<p class='c006' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'>55</a></span>
I must, however, confess that the plant,
upon which this experiment was made, had
been kept through the winter. With a
young one the result might possibly be different;
but such an one I have not yet had
it in my power to procure.</p>

<p class='c006' >The torpedo does not appear at all affected
by the influence which itself produces. Animals,
in which Galvani’s phenomena are produced,
are strongly affected. From this circumstance,
and still more from the presence
of metals being absolutely requisite to their
production, some may be induced to believe,
that the influence, which causes them,
is something external to animals; and that
it arises from the mutual contact of the metals
only. I must confess I was, for some
time, inclined to entertain this opinion;
and its probability appeared to be not a
little increased by observing that its effects
differed with the metals employed, and
were strongest when their surfaces were extended,
and applied horizontally to each
other. I began, therefore, to suspect that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'>56</a></span>
it might be some hitherto undiscovered property
of metals; for that it was not an electrical
phenomenon, seemed still further
proved by the circumstance above related.
It has been demonstrated, by the very interesting
discoveries of M. Volta, that,
‘wherever the capacity of holding electricity
is greater, there the intensity of electricity
is less’:&mdash;‘and that the capacity of
a conductor is increased, when, instead
of remaining quite insulated, the conductor
is presented to another conductor not
insulated; and this increase is more conspicuous,
according as the surfaces of those
conductors are larger, and come nearer
to each other<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c008'><sup>[10]</sup></a>.’</p>

<p class='c006' >When, therefore, a plate of silver, communicating
with the leg of a frog, was laid
upon glass, and a plate of zinc was lowered
horizontally upon it, the capacities of both,
for any electricity which they might have
contained, must have been so much increased,
that no one will suspect the contractions
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'>57</a></span>
of the frog’s leg, to have been occasioned
by any discharge of the electrical fluid from
them.</p>

<p class='c006' >As little are we authorised to suppose,
that the contractions were produced in consequence
of the metals attracting the electrical
fluid from the leg: for, since the leg was
insulated, it is impossible that it should have
received a new supply of electricity, after
having been deprived by the metals of what
it naturally possessed; and consequently, after
once or twice contracting, no further
contractions should have taken place: but
this is contrary to the fact.</p>

<p class='c006' >I have before shewn, that flakes of gold
leaf, placed between the metals, were not
affected by their approach to each other;
and that, besides, a quantity of electricity,
sufficient strongly to affect an electrometer,
was far too weak to excite contractions
in the muscles of a frog.</p>

<p class='c006' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'>58</a></span>
That this influence, however, whatever
it be, is not derived from the metals alone,
but that animals at least contribute to its
production, as well as indicate its presence,
is, I think, rendered highly probable, by what
I have already urged, relative to the necessity
of a communication between the metals,
and the muscles, as well as between
the metals and the nerves.</p>

<p class='c006' >I may likewise observe, that animals appear
to have a much more complete controul
over its effects, than one would expect
them to have over an influence wholely
external to them.</p>

<p class='c006' >When living and entire frogs are placed
upon a plate of zinc, or tin-foil, and a piece
of silver, or of gold, is passed over different
parts of their legs, and thighs, till it come
into contact with the plate; contractions
are very seldom produced, and scarcely ever,
if the frogs be healthy and upon their guard.
But the instant their sciatic nerves are divided,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'>59</a></span>
the contractions produced are as free
and vigorous, as if the legs had been completely
separated from the body. This difference
is not owing to the silver coming
in contact with the wound, necessarily made
in order to divide the nerve; for I have always
taken care that it should not, and indeed
when it did, no contractions were produced,
unless the nerve had been divided.</p>

<p class='c006' >Taking off the head of an animal, or intercepting,
in any way, the influence of its
will upon the muscles of the part excited,
has precisely the same effect. But the will
is not able to controul the effects of electricity,
when the electricity is otherwise sufficiently
strong to excite muscles to contraction.
I have repeatedly found that even
by the strongest voluntary contractions of
the muscles of my arm, I have not been
able altogether to counteract the involuntary
ones, produced by electrical sparks,
nor have I found that frogs could ever
counteract them.</p>

<p class='c006' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_60' id='Page_60'>60</a></span>
On attending carefully to the state of the
muscles of the legs of living frogs, at the
instant the metals were applied, I could perceive
by the touch, that, in many frogs,
though by no means in all, their muscles
were perfectly soft and relaxed: a proof
that they have other means of counteracting
the involuntary contractions, which the
metals have a tendency to produce, besides
keeping their muscles in a state of permanent
and voluntary contraction.</p>

<p class='c006' ><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On this metal Cronstedt has the following very curious
remark: “It seems to become electrical by friction,
and then its smaller particles are attracted by the
loadstone; which effects are not yet properly investigated.”
Zinc is an ingredient of the best amalgam for
smearing the rubbers of electrical machines: But I have
not been able to render a bar of zinc electrical by friction,
nor to find that its smaller particles were in any state
attracted by the loadstone, unless they had been scraped
off by means of an instrument of iron. But, in this
way, the dust of any metal is rendered susceptible of the
influence of the loadstone.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c006' ><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If further experiments should establish decidedly,
that the mutual contact of two different metals is absolutely
necessary for the productions of Galvani’s phenomena,
may not this circumstance afford an useful test of
the purity of the precious metals? For instance, contractions
in an animal produced by the contact of a
piece of gold or silver, whose purity we wish to ascertain,
with a piece of the same metal known to be pure,
would then prove incontestably the presence of alloy.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c006' ><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In an able lecture, which Dr Monro lately delivered,
chiefly upon this subject, he demonstrated the
possibility of exciting contractions in the limb of a frog,
without either of the metals he employed being in contact
with it; or having any other communication with it
than through the medium of some moist substance. In
varying this experiment, I find, that if a frog be divided
in two parts, just above the origin of the sciatic nerves,
and put into a bason of water, the hind legs may be
thrown into strong contractions, by bringing zinc, or
tin-foil, and silver, in contact with each other, at the
distance of at least an inch from the divided spine, so
long as they are kept nearly in a right line with it.
Water, in this case, is the only communication between
the metals and the origin of the nerves.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c006' ><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The contractions produced seemed to be strong in
proportion to the extent of the surfaces of the metals
in contact, strongest when a large plate of zinc is laid
horizontally upon a large plate of silver or gold. If
the zinc be suffered to remain in contact with the silver,
for a little time, the contractions of the leg cease.
The zinc may then be slid over the silver, till it even
touch the leg without renewing the contractions: but,
in withdrawing the silver, the leg contracts at the instant
the silver parts from it!</p>

of influencing animals, as a test of remaining life in any
part of them.</p>

<p class='c006' >They were constantly kept in fresh water, as the situation
most natural to them, during the whole of the
time they were under experiment; and their skins were

their skins, to the action of the water.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c006' ><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>M. Fontana, in the first volume of his work on
Poisons, mentions some facts, which may, to some, appear
to give considerable countenance to this explanation.
The microscopical eels found in dry and smutty
wheat; the seta equina or gordius of Linnaeus; and the
wheal polypus, all, when dry, become apparently dead:
but again recover motion and life when moistened
with water. One of the latter was put, by M. Fontana,
upon a bit of glass, and exposed, during a whole summer,
to the noon-day sun. It became so dry that it was like
a piece of hardened glue. A few drops of water, however,
did not fail to restore it to life. Another was, in
this way, recovered after a similar exposure of a year
and a half. Father Gumillo, a Jesuit, and the Indians
of Peru, are quoted by the same author, on the authority
of Bonguer, as speaking of ‘a large and venemous
snake, which being dead and dried in the open air, or
in the smoke of a chimney, has the property of coming
again to life, on its being exposed, for some days,
to the sun, in a stagnant and corrupted water.’</p>

<p class='c006' >But it would almost require the credulity of an Indian
to credit the testimony of the Jesuit.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c006' ><span class='label'><a href='#r9'>9</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Since what I had before written upon this subject
went to the press, I have been informed by a friend,
that Dr Lind of Windsor has found, that contractions
may be excited in a frog by touching it with iron alone.
In a frog very recently killed, I have myself, sometimes,
excited contractions, by touching its nerves with iron
and steel in conjunction. But I can by no means consider
this as a satisfactory proof, that contractions may
be excited by the contact of one metal alone; since I
have never been able to excite contractions with a piece
of iron, of the same quality throughout, applied to a
frog which had been so long dead as to leave no suspicion
that the contractions were occasioned by mechanical
irritation. In Dr Valli’s experiment, with scissars
of bad steel, upon a frog recently killed, these circumstances
do not appear to have been sufficiently attended
to.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>OF THE MUSCLES.</h3>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_5_0_6 c011'     >As I am acquainted with no criterion
by which we can assure ourselves of
the complete separation of muscular fibres
from nerves, without rendering them objects
too minute for accurate experiment;
it can never be in our power, so far as I
am able to judge, to satisfy ourselves, if
this new influence can act immediately
upon the muscular fibre. A doubt must always
remain, whether nerve has not been
present; and from this doubt will arise another
still more difficult to solve, whether
the influence produced or excited by the
metals have passed through the nerve to
the muscles? or if it have merely acted as
a stimulus to the nerve, serving to rouse
that unknown energy, by which nerves are
known in certain circumstances to excite
muscles to contraction.</p>

<p class='c006' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_65' id='Page_65'>65</a></span>
The following experiments, made upon
animals considered by anatomists, in general,
as destitute of nerves, may to some appear
decisive of this question, but to myself,
I confess, they are by no means so. In by
far the greater number of animals, we are
precluded from the possibility of discovering
nerves by their minuteness; yet the actions
of these animals, not merely excited
by mechanical irritation, but so obviously
directed to the attainment of an end, oblige
us to infer their existence even where
our senses, aided by the best glasses, do not
enable us to detect them.</p>

<p class='c006' >Having laid some earth worms upon a
plate of zinc, I tried to excite contractions
in them, by passing a rod of silver over different
parts of their length, till it came in
contact with the plate; but for a long time
without producing any effect. Application
of the metals to a part recently divided
seemed to produce as little effect. At
length, I perceived one of them dart itself
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'>66</a></span>
forwards, whenever the silver was passed
under its belly near to a part which had
been divided and rejoined. On repeating
the experiment again, and with more care,
I found, (as in the frog,) that when the
animal was perfectly lively, and upon its
guard, no contraction could in this way be
excited; but that when a part had been
rendered more sensible by previous disease,
recent irritation, &amp;c. or when the worm
was taken unawares by hanging it over a
probe, and lowering both upon the plate at
the same instant; a sudden and involuntary
motion seemed to dart through a great part
of the worm’s length from the part touched
towards the head; a direction contrary
to that in which it takes place in other animals.
I never could produce the same effect
upon leeches. On varying the experiment,
a most whimsical, but satisfactory
phenomenon presented itself. I had laid
a leech upon a crown piece of silver, placed
in the middle of a large plate of zinc.
The animal moved its mouth over the surface
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_67' id='Page_67'>67</a></span>
of the silver without expressing the
least uneasiness; but having stretched beyond
it and touched the zinc plate with its
mouth, it instantly recoiled, as if in the
most acute pain, and continued thus alternately
touching and recoiling from the zinc,
till it had the appearance of being quite fatigued.
When placed wholly upon the
zinc, it seemed perfectly at its ease; but,
when at any time its mouth came in contact
with the silver lying upon the zinc, the
same expression of pain was exhibited as
before.</p>

<p class='c006' >With the earth worm, this experiment
succeeded still more decisively. The animal
sprang from the zinc in writhing convulsions;
if, when the worm stretched itself
forwards, one of its folds lit upon the zinc,
it expressed little uneasiness in comparison
of what it shewed when the point of its
head touched the zinc.</p>

<p class='c006' >These extraordinary effects were, however,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'>68</a></span>
considerably different from those produced
by the metals upon the limbs of
frogs, and other animals. They had not so
much the appearance of involuntary, instantaneous
convulsions, as long continued expressions
of pain and disgust; such as are
produced by applying zinc and silver to the
tongue of a child.</p>

<p class='c006' >A strong presumptive proof, in my humble
opinion, that these animals are endowed
with a most exquisite organ of sense, and,
consequently, that they are not, as has been
supposed, destitute of a nervous system.</p>

<p class='c006' >Doubtful, therefore, if this influence can
ever act upon the muscular fibre, except
through the medium of nerves, I shall reserve
what I have to say upon particular
muscles, till I have related some facts relative
to the nerves.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>OF THE NERVES.</h3>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_6 c011'     >It appears from every experiment, which
has been made in prosecution of Galvani’s
discovery, that the nerves are very essentially
concerned, in all the phenomena
which it exhibits. It becomes, therefore, an
object of inquiry, highly interesting, to ascertain
if all the nerves of the body are equally
subjects of this new influence, or if
its effects are confined to those appropriated
to muscles of voluntary motion. With this
view, I surrounded with tin-foil the parvagum
and intercostal nerves of several cows
and sheep, while the auricles of their hearts
were still contracting, and placed one end
of a bent silver rod, at one time upon the
heart itself, at another upon adjacent muscles,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_70' id='Page_70'>70</a></span>
and sometimes upon the nerves; but
all without producing the slightest perceptible
variations, in the contractions of the
heart, or a renewal of them when they had
ceased.</p>

<p class='c006' >I likewise included the caroted artery in
the tin-foil; and, at another time, inserted the
foil in longitudinal incisions made in the
nerves, that it might be more immediately
in contact with their substance; but still no
contractions followed. I had as little success
when I made similar experiments upon a
dog, cats, rabbits, fowls, and frogs; yet, in
all these animals, I could in general excite
vigorous contractions, by arming the nerves
of parts obedient to the will: I say in general,
for in rabbits I have sometimes failed
altogether; especially when they have been
drowned in very cold water. Soon after
making these experiments, I perceived from
one of Dr Valli’s letters, published in the
Journal de Physique, that he had made a
similar one upon the heart of a dog, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_71' id='Page_71'>71</a></span>
with the same result. The heart, through
the medium of its nerves, is not excitable,
therefore, by the same means which are
found efficacious in exciting other muscles
to contraction. I confess I had not expected
this result. It has been asserted indeed, by
many physiologists of the first name<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c008'><sup>[11]</sup></a>, that
the heart can in nowise be affected by the
application of a stimulus to its nerves, or to
the brain; but many considerations excited
my doubts upon this subject, and some experiments
which I made at this place, more
than a year ago, tended to confirm me in
an opposite opinion. That both the frequency,
and the strength of the heart’s contractions
are affected by passions of the
mind, is a fact known to every one; but
what is much more to the purpose, since
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'>72</a></span>
we know so little either of mind or of its
mode of influencing the body, we know
that many derangements of the brain, such
as apoplexy, hydrocephalus, phrenitis, &amp;c.
together with all kinds of mechanical injuries,
(and what are these, but so many stimuli
irritating the brain, and consequently
the nerves sent to the heart?) affect the
motions of the heart most materially and
obviously. The contractions of the heart,
so long as the brain remains entire, may be
affected by a thousand different substances
thrown into the stomach; but it appears
from the experiment of Mr Kite, that this
is by no means the case, when the functions
of the brain are suspended by hanging, or
drowning<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c008'><sup>[12]</sup></a>. Dr Whytt’s experiment on
this subject is one of the most decisive
with which I am acquainted. He found,
that opium operates much more slowly in
destroying the heart’s motion in frogs, deprived
of their brain and spinal marrow,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'>73</a></span>
than it does when these animals ate entire.
Several of my own experiments, though
not made expressly with this view, gave
the same result with those of Dr Whytt.
M. Fontana tells us, he has discovered the
heart of the wheel polypus to be a voluntary
muscle. It was probably this discovery
which led him to try the effects of his
will upon his own heart. For the success
of his experiment, we have the testimony
of his friend Dr Gerardi, Professor of Anatomy
in the University of Parma, who, in
a very learned little Dissertation on the Origin
of the Intercostal Nerve, published in
the Journal de Physique for September last,
makes the following short mention of it;
‘Je ne dois point oublier de vous dire que
M. Fontana a la faculté d’accélérer, ou de
retarder à volonté son pouls, sans aucune
contraction sensible des muscles.’</p>

<p class='c006' >The direct experiments, by which I was
first led to adopt the opinion that the heart
might be affected by the mechanical irritation
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_74' id='Page_74'>74</a></span>
of its nerves, were made upon very
young cats and rabbits; some with the assistance
of my friend Dr Physick, now settled
in Philadelphia; others in presence of
several other gentlemen studying at this
university. It appeared very decidedly
from two or three of these experiments,
that the contractions of the heart were quickened
by irritating the brain at the origin
of the spinal marrow. In others again, the
result was by no means so clear. But it
should be recollected that the evidence of
one accurate, and positive experiment, is
not in the least invalidated by twenty unsuccessful
ones, especially upon animals of
warm blood; where the irritability of their
muscles is so very fleeting, and the result
liable to variation from so many, as yet, unknown
causes. The irritability of the arteries,
for example, is now completely established,
yet Haller’s experiments led him to
deny it. And even those of the accurate
Verschnir, to whom we are indebted for unquestionably
the best series of experiments
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'>75</a></span>
upon this subject, failed of success (as we
are told by Dr Dennison, in an excellent
Thesis confirming their truth,) when repeated
before some of the Faculty here. Immediately,
therefore, on discovering the
superior powers of zinc, and molybdena, in
exciting contractions, I began again to repeat
with these metals the experiments on
the nerves passing to the hearts of frogs;
but for a long time without satisfying either
myself, or others, whether any effect was
really produced. At length, however, I
was so happy as to succeed completely.
On the 18th of March last, in presence of
my friends, Mr Hunter and Mr Thomson,
having dissected away the pericardium from
a frog’s heart, which had an hour before
ceased spontaneously to contract, I removed
the muscles, and cellular membrane covering
its nerves, and large blood vessels.
I then placed one end of a rod of pure silver
in contact with one side of these nerves,
and blood vessels, and one end of a rod of
zinc on the other, both of them at about
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>76</a></span>
the distance of the third part of an inch
from the auricles of the heart. On bringing
the opposite ends of these rods in contact
with each other, the auricle first, and
then the ventricle of the heart immediately
contracted, and repeated their contractions
as often as the ends of the metal rods were
made to touch each other. When a stick
of glass, wax, or wood, was made use of
in place of one of the metals, no contraction
took place. Contractions, however,
were excited by irritating the heart itself
with the point of a sharp instrument. The
contractions were both more vigorous, and
more constant when the metals were placed
in contact with the heart itself, than
when touching only its blood vessels and
nerves. I have several times attempted to
trace some of the nerves, which may be
seen near the large blood vessels of the heart
of a frog, into the heart itself, in order to
arm them separated from other parts; but,
partly on account of their minuteness, and
partly on account of the weak state of my
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_77' id='Page_77'>77</a></span>
eyes, which does not permit me to look intently
at minute objects, I have never been
able to succeed.</p>

<p class='c006' >Since making this last experiment, I have
repeated it upwards of twenty times. In order
to its complete success, it is necessary
that the spontaneous contractions of the
heart should nearly, if not altogether, have
ceased; and, when in this state, the experiment
is rendered still more satisfactory by
removing the heart from the body of the
frog, and laying it upon a plate of zinc.
We are then sure that its contractions cannot
have been excited, by any mechanical
irritation, arising from the contractions of
the muscles of the thorax.</p>

<p class='c006' >For want of sufficient leisure, and convenient
opportunities, I have neglected to
make this experiment upon any animals of
warm blood, except cats and rabbits. A
few days after I had discovered the possibility
of exciting the heart to contraction by
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_78' id='Page_78'>78</a></span>
means of zinc, and silver applied to its
nerves, I procured an ordinary sized cat,
and drowned it in water, as nearly as possible,
of its own temperature. Four minutes
after immersion, it was taken out of the water
and dryed. Its thorax was immediately
laid open, but no contractions were observed
in any part of its heart, except in the
right auricle, and even these were very
slight. A plate of zinc was then placed in
contact with the parvagum, and intercostal
nerves, on one side of the trachea, and a
half crown piece in contact with those of
the other; both at the distance of about one
third of an inch from the auricles. Every
time the zinc and silver were brought into
contact, complete contractions of the right
auricle, and sometimes slight ones of the
left were produced, but none in the ventricles.
The contractions were observed to
become stronger, in proportion as the metals
were approached to the heart, and were
strongest when one or both was in contact
with the auricle. I think the contractions
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_79' id='Page_79'>79</a></span>
were fully as strong when molybdena, as
when silver was used. No contractions
could be excited, by arming any of the
nerves of voluntary muscles, in this cat.</p>

<p class='c006' >The next experiment was made upon a
female cat, far gone with young. She was
drowned in very cold water, and although
her thorax was opened the instant she had
ceased to struggle, which was in less than
four minutes after immersion, her heart had
ceased to contract; nor could its contractions
be renewed, either by the application
of the metals in the way described, in the
last experiment, or by pricking or otherwise
irritating its surface: but the diaphragm,
the intercostal muscles, the fore legs,
and the ears, continued to contract long
and vigorously, when the metals were as
usual applied to their nerves. On cutting
into the uterus, however, and taking out
one of the young, I found both auricles and
ventricles of its heart, contracting most vigorously,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_80' id='Page_80'>80</a></span>
though the mother had now been
dead upwards of twenty minutes.</p>

<p class='c006' >An opportunity, not to be neglected, now
presented itself, of trying if it were possible
to transmit this influence from the mother
to the fœtus, through the medium of the
umbilical chord. I therefore applied the
two metals in the manner I before described,
1st, to the uterus of the mother, and to
the cotyledans; afterwards to several different
parts of her; but neither uterus nor fœtus
were in any instance affected. As little
was the fœtus affected, by arming the chord
itself. As the hearts of the kittens continued
their spontaneous contractions, for
more than an hour after they were taken
from the mother, I had repeatedly the pleasure
of observing, and pointing out to Mr
Thomson, and Mr Simpson, who obligingly
lent me their assistance in these experiments,
the effects of the metals when in
contact with the parvagum, and entercostal
nerves, both of quickening the repetition
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_81' id='Page_81'>81</a></span>
of the hearts contractions, while they
continued spontaneous, and of exciting them
anew when they had ceased to be so. This
experiment, repeated upon a kitten a few
days after birth, succeeded, but not quite in
so satisfactory a manner as the foregoing,
although the heart continued contracting for
more than an hour and an half after the
thorax was opened. Its contractions were
quickened, and rendered vibratory by the
slightest mechanical touch of its surface; so
that it was difficult to determine the precise
share which the application of the metals
had in their production.</p>

<p class='c006' >When these had ceased, I did not find
that I could revive them by the application
of the metals. In the hearts of some young
rabbits, upon which I tried this experiment,
the contractions appeared to be still
more decidedly, occasioned by the application
of the metals, than even in the cats.</p>

<p class='c006' >Having ascertained this important fact,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_82' id='Page_82'>82</a></span>
that one muscle, not subjected to the influence
of the will, might be made to contract
by the application of zinc and silver
to its nerves; I proceeded to examine
whether the same were the case with respect
to all involuntary muscles. I could not,
however, observe that any contractions
were produced in the stomach or intestines,
by placing the metals near the stomachic
flexus and semilunar ganglion in a cat. I
next proceeded to examine the effects of
the metals upon the different organs of
sense.</p>

<p class='c006' >M. Volta’s discovery of the sensation
produced upon the end of the tongue, by
coating its upper and under surfaces with
different metals, led me to compare this
sensation with that produced by electricity.
I found a very considerable difference between
them. Both, indeed, are subacid,
but as unlike to each other, as the taste of
vinegar is to that of diluted vitriolic acid.
That occasioned by the metals is accompanied
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_83' id='Page_83'>83</a></span>
with what is familiarly called the
metallic taste; and differs according to the
metals employed. With the greater number
of metals it is scarcely perceptible.
With zinc and gold, I think, it is strongest;
next so with zinc and silver, or molybdena,
and insufferably disagreeable with any of
them.</p>

<p class='c006' >The sensation is most distinct when the
tongue is of its ordinary temperature, and
when the metals are of the same temperature
with the tongue. When either the
tongue, or the metals, or both, are heated
or cooled, as far as can be borne without
inconvenience, scarcely any sensation is produced.
That this difference in the effect is
owing to the alteration which has been
produced in the state of the tongue, and
not to that in the temperature of the metals,
is evident from experiments which I
have already related; from which it appears
that neither the conducting, nor the
exciting powers of metals are affected by
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_84' id='Page_84'>84</a></span>
differences of their temperature. But I
have found it the uniform result of many
experiments, that both the life and irritability
of the most vigorous frogs is completely
destroyed in a few minutes, by placing
them in water heated to 106 degrees of
Fahrenheit’s scale.</p>

<p class='c006' >Cold, however, though it appears to affect
the sensibility of the tongue nearly as
much as heat, did not, in one or two instances
in which I tried it, affect the irritability
of the muscles of a frog. Some separated
legs contracted equally well after
they had lain upon a piece of ice for some
hours, as they did before they had been in
that situation.</p>

<p class='c006' >Whatever has a tendency to blunt the
sensibility of the tongue, as laudanum, a
strong solution of opium in water, distilled
spirits, acids, &amp;c. diminishes the effect of
the metals. Acids, I think, diminish it
least.</p>

<p class='c006' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_85' id='Page_85'>85</a></span>
On placing different metals in the meatus
auditorius externus of both my ears,
and establishing an insulated metallic communication
between them, I felt, or fancied
that I felt, a disagreeable jirk of my head.
The metals used were a silver probe, a roll
of tin-foil, and a common brass conductor
belonging to an electrical machine. On
withdrawing them from my ears, I experienced
a feeling similar to that which one
has after emerging from under water. I
was not sensible of having hurt my ears by
the experiment, nor had I any uneasy sensation
after it; but, on getting out of bed
next morning, I perceived both my pillow
and my face stained with blood; and, on
examining, found that it had come from one
of my ears. An hæmorrhagy from this part
had never happened to me before. From
whatever cause this accident happened, (and
it is highly probable that it arose from some
hurt unperceived at the time), I need not
say, that I have never repeated the experiment,
and that I certainly never shall.</p>

<p class='c006' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_86' id='Page_86'>86</a></span>
I never could perceive, that the senses,
either of touch or of smell, were in the least
affected by the metals; but the effect which
they produce upon the eye is very remarkable.
Having laid a piece of tin-foil upon
the point of my tongue, I placed the rounded
end of a silver pencil-case, against the
ball of my eye, in the inner canthus, and
suffered them to remain in these situations
till the parts were so far accustomed to them,
that I could examine the sensations produced;
I then brought the metals into contact
with each other, and, to my surprise, perceived
a pale flash of light diffuse itself over
the whole of my eye. My tongue was at
the same time affected with a similar sensation
to that produced when both the metals
are in contact with it. On darkening
the room, the flash became more distinct,
and of a stronger colour. This sensation
is not the effect of pressure upon the eye, as
in Sir Isaac Newton’s experiment; for no
pressure should be used. All that is required,
is, that the silver lie between the lids of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_87' id='Page_87'>87</a></span>
the eye, and in contact with any part of the
ball. If the experiment be made with zinc
and gold, instead of tin-foil and silver, the
flash is incomparably more vivid. I had
the disagreeable opportunity of trying this
experiment upon one of my eyes, in a state
of inflammation; and, in this case, found the
flash much more strong than it was in the
uninflamed eye. I tried it likewise upon a
patient, affected with amaurosis; but the
man was so stupid that I could not satisfy
myself as to the precise result.</p>

<p class='c006' >Recollecting that fine nervous twigs pass
from the ciliary or ophthalmic ganglion,
through the sclerotic coat of the eye, to the
choroid coat, and to the uvea; and that this
ganglion is in great part formed from a twig
of the nasal branch, of the fifth pair of
nerves, in conjunction with a branch of the
third, I proceeded to try if, by insinuating
a rod of silver, as far as possible, up my nose,
and thus arming this nasal branch, I could,
by bringing the silver into contact with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_88' id='Page_88'>88</a></span>
piece of zinc, placed upon my tongue, pass
this new influence up the course of the
nerve, and thus produce the flash in the
eye. The experiment answered my most
sanguine expectation. The flash, in this way
produced, is, I think, if any thing, stronger
than when the ball of the eye itself is armed.
I now thought I had discovered a certain
method, by which I could ascertain the
effect of Galvani’s influence, upon a very
important, involuntary muscle, the human
iris. It occurred to me that the ingenious
physiologist Dr Whytt, had been able,
through the medium of the nasal branch of
the fifth pair of nerves, to produce, at pleasure,
dilatations of the contracted pupil of
a boy, in the last stage of hydrocephalus,
by applying aq. ammonia to his nostrils;
and this instance of the affection, of an involuntary
muscle, through the medium of
its nerves, had, previously to making any
experiments upon the subject, always operated
with me as a strong presumptive argument,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_89' id='Page_89'>89</a></span>
that the contractions of the heart
might be influenced in a similar manner.</p>

<p class='c006' >I therefore desired some of my friends to
observe my pupil, while I repeated the
experiment, which I have above described.
When the external light was strong, they
found some difficulty in determining, whether
the pupil contracted or not; but when
no more light was admitted, than what was
just sufficient for discerning the pupil, they
perceived a very distinct contraction, every
time the metals were brought into contact
with each other. This experiment requires
some attention, in order that it may succeed
satisfactorily; but although I have repeated
it a great number of times upon the eyes of
others, it has seldom failed, when made in
a steady light, and when the silver has been
passed far enough up the nose.</p>

<p class='c006' >The dilatation of the pupil, instead of its
contraction, on the application of a stimulus
to its nerves, as in the case related by Dr
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_90' id='Page_90'>90</a></span>
Whytt, is, I apprehend, not so uncommon
a circumstance, as it may at first be supposed.
I have myself seen three instances of
it in diseases of the head. One of these was
in an epileptic patient, whose pupils, during
the intervals of his fits, became suddenly
dilated whenever his eyes were exposed
to a strong light.</p>

<p class='c006' >My friend, Mr George Hunter of York,
while one day amusing himself with repeating
some of these experiments, discovered
that by placing one of the metals as
high up as possible between the gums and the
upper lip, and the other in a similar situation
with respect to the under lip, a flash
was produced as vivid as that occasioned
by passing one of the metals up the nose,
and placing the other upon the tongue. It
differs, however, from the flash produced
in any other way, in the singular circumstance
of not being confined to the eye
alone, but appearing diffused over the whole
of the face. On attending to the concomitant
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_91' id='Page_91'>91</a></span>
sensations produced by this disposition
of the metals, I perceived that a sense
of warmth, at the instant they were brought
into contact, diffused itself over the whole
upper surface of the tongue, proceeding
from its root to the point. Dr Rutherford,
to whom Mr Hunter had communicated
this experiment, remarked, on repeating it,
that a flash is produced not only at the instant
the metals are brought into contact,
but likewise at the instant of their separation.
While they remain in contact, no
flash is observed.</p>

<p class='c006' >This fact is precisely analogous to one
already mentioned of contractions being
produced in the leg of a frog, at the instant
one of the metals in contact with the other
metal is withdrawn from the leg.</p>

<p class='c006' >After this full detail of these curious phenomena,
I hardly need remark, that they
demonstrate the free communication, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_92' id='Page_92'>92</a></span>
subsists between the several branches of the
fifth pair of nerves, and consequently give
strong support, if not absolute confirmation,
to the well known doctrine of nervous
sympathy, or of the reciprocal influence,
which different parts exert upon each other,
through the medium of nerves.</p>

<p class='c006' >If I might be allowed to hazard a conjecture,
where we cannot have recourse to
demonstration, I should say that the flash,
observed in the above experiments, was the
effect of contractions excited in involuntary
muscles by the application of a stimulus to
their nerves; or, in other words, that the effects
of the application of the metals to the
nasal branch of the first division of the fifth
pair of nerves, had been propagated through
the ciliary ganglion, along the ciliary nerves,
and to the choroid coat, whose vessels it
had excited into instantaneous action; and
that their action again (as in the case of
action excited by pressure, or a blow upon
the eye,) had by stimulating the retina occasioned
the sense of light.</p>

<p class='c006' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_93' id='Page_93'>93</a></span>
This supposition is, I think, rendered
probable by several considerations. I have
already shewn that this influence can excite
contractions in involuntary muscles, through
the medium of their nerves. And certainly
no reason can be assigned, <i>a priori</i>, why
it should not act equally upon every description
of involuntary muscles; upon those
which make a part of the minutest vessels
in the body, as well as upon the heart, or
upon the iris.</p>

<p class='c006' >That it excites to increased action the
arteries of the tongue in the experiment, in
which a sense of warmth is produced along
its surface by the application of the metals
to the lips, seems to be almost demonstrated;
for it would be difficult to point out
the presence of another cause competent to
occasion the evolution of the heat, in this
case, besides the increased action of the arteries:
and that this cause is competent to
the effect we know from numberless experiments,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_94' id='Page_94'>94</a></span>
too familiar to need being particularized
here.</p>

<p class='c006' >Whether the metals, however, do or do
not affect the action of the blood vessels, is
a question which admits of solution by experiment.
The following, I confess, was not
quite satisfactory, and I have not yet found
leisure and opportunity to repeat it with all
the attention it requires.</p>

<p class='c006' >I inspected the foot of a living frog with
a microscope of very high powers. In fixing
the foot so as to keep the web expanded,
a considerable degree of inflammation
was excited, notwithstanding every precaution
to avoid it. The current of blood was
seen distinctly in several vessels, now flowing
rapidly, now slowly, and now in a direction
contrary to that in which it was first
observed, but with equal rapidity. A thin
plate of zinc was introduced between the
fleshy part of the foot and its supporter, and
a silver probe was used as an excitor. To
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_95' id='Page_95'>95</a></span>
me, the circulation appeared very decidedly
to be quickened several times when the
metals were made to touch each other: but
the gentlemen who assisted me could observe
no change. To prevent the contractions
in the muscles of the leg from producing
any fallacy, the crural artery should
be laid bare, and insulated from surrounding
parts, by passing a thin plate of glass, or
sealing wax, between it and them.</p>

<p class='c006' >That the flash is the effect of such an increased
action of the vessels, composing the
choroid coat, might be somewhat more difficult
to prove. It is however known to
every one, that a blow, and that pressure
upon the eye, are capable, as I have before
observed, of producing a similar effect. And
the following case, which Bonetus quotes
from Hermannus Cummius, if it may be
credited, affords an almost positive proof,
that vision depends upon the stimulus given
to the retina by the activity of blood vessels
in some part of the eye. ‘Quando theologus,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_96' id='Page_96'>96</a></span>
plaga dolorifica, a rupta instrumenti
musici chorda accepta, nocte subsequenti
jam adulta, e somno evigilans, cuncta clare,
ac si de die esset, vidit, adeo, ut minimos
picturarum et tapetum tractus observare,
characteresque ex libro legere posset.
Oculo vero læso clauso, tenebras densissimas
adesse ille percepit, eodemque iterum
aperto, conclave illustratum visum est, lucem
tamen candelæ allatae solisque splendorem
de die, ægre tulit oculus affectus,
quod per aliquot dies duravit, tandemque
sensim remisit.’</p>

<p class='c006' >Haller speaks of such cases as by no
means uncommon, and quotes the names
of several authors, who have related similar
ones.</p>

<p class='c006' >The direction of this influence, when
suffered to pursue its natural course, appears
to be the same with that of most other stimuli,
i. e. from the place at which it first affects
a nerve, onwards to the part, in which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_97' id='Page_97'>97</a></span>
that nerve terminates. I have repeatedly
caused electrical sparks to be passed into
my own ulnar nerve at its passage over the
inner condyle of the humerus, but both
the sensations and the contractions produced
by them have been entirely confined
to the hand and fore arm.</p>

<p class='c006' >It appears too, both from the experiments
of Dr Monro, and of Dr William Alexander
of Halifax in Yorkshire, that when no
communication is left between the trunk
and posterior extremities of a frog, except
by its sciatic nerves, a strong solution of
opium, injected under the skin of its posterior
extremities, deprives them both of
their sensibility and of their contractile
power; but that it does not in the least affect
the trunk of the body. If, on the contrary,
it be applied to the trunk, it exhausts
both the trunk and the extremities.</p>

<p class='c006' >M. Galvani is said to have observed the effects
of the influence, which he discovered,
diffused over the whole body of a frog, when
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_98' id='Page_98'>98</a></span>
the metals were applied to a nerve merely
laid bare, without being either divided or
separated from surrounding parts. If we
are allowed to infer this diffusion of the influence
from the restlessness expressed by
the animal, M. Galvani’s observation may
be just. If from the contractions produced,
I suspect it is by no means so; since, in
every experiment which I have made upon
the subject, the contractions have been
confined to those parts to which the nerve
touched by the metals was distributed.</p>

<p class='c006' >That this influence, however, may pass
in a direction contrary to the course of
nerves, is evident from some of the experiments
which I have related relative to its
effects upon the senses, but is still more
clearly demonstrated by the following.</p>

<p class='c006' >If, after having divided at the pelvis a
frog recently killed, the sciatic nerves be
freed from cellular membrane up to their
origin from the spine, and all the parts below
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_99' id='Page_99'>99</a></span>
this, except themselves, be cut away,
the muscles on each side of the spine, for
some little way up, may be brought into
contraction by touching the nerves alone
with the two metals in contact. This experiment
has not always succeeded with
me, and never unless the frog had been recently
killed. So long as the hind legs remain
undivided from the nerves, it never
succeeded; the only contractions produced
being in the legs.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>OF THE BLOOD VESSELS.</h3>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_6 c011'     >We are told by Dr Valli, that no contractions
are excited by arming
the blood vessels; but as he has not told us
whether his experiments were made upon
them while the blood still continued to flow
through them, or after they had been deprived
of their blood, I determined to make
the following experiment.</p>

<p class='c006' >Having laid bare, and separated from
surrounding parts and from each other, the
crural artery, and nerve, in the thigh of a
full grown frog, I cut out the whole of
the nerve between the pelvis and the knee.
I then insinuated beneath the artery a thin
plate of sealing wax, spread upon paper, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_101' id='Page_101'>101</a></span>
broad enough to keep a large portion of
the artery completely apart from the rest of
the thigh. The blood still continued to flow,
through the whole course of the artery, in
an undiminished stream. The artery, thus
partially insulated, was touched with silver
and zinc, which were then brought into
contact with each other; but no contraction
whatever was produced, in any muscle of
the limb. This experiment was frequently
repeated upon several different frogs, both
in whom the nerve was, and in whom it
was not, divided. The result was uniformly
the same. But vivid contractions were
produced in the whole limb, when an electrical
spark, or even a full stream of the aura,
was passed into the artery.</p>

<p class='c006' >It, however, by no means follows from
this experiment, that the sanguiferous system
of animals bears no relation whatever
to the influence discovered by Galvani. I
have already shewn, that the heart may be
affected by it, and have given reason to believe,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_102' id='Page_102'>102</a></span>
that the smallest arteries of the body
are not exempted from its action. Should
it ever be proved to be an exclusive property
of animals, it is not impossible but
that even its origin may be traced to their
sanguiferous system.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>SECTION IV.<br /> <br /><i>An attempt to investigate the Source from which the respective<br />Powers of Nerves, and of Muscles, are derived.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_5_0_6 c005'     >As yet, the question whence the nerves
and muscles of animals derive their
respective properties, remains in a state of
doubt. By many, the brain has been considered
as the source not only of the several
energies exerted by nerves, whether appropriated
to sensation, to the excitement
of muscles subservient to the will, or distributed
to organs exempted from its influence;
but likewise of that unascertained
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_104' id='Page_104'>104</a></span>
power, by which muscles contract on the
application of a stimulus.</p>

<p class='c006' >By others again, these several properties
are supposed to be derived from the arteries,
which may either supply the materials and
construction of that exquisite and peculiar
organization, which fits nerves and muscles
for performing their respective functions,
or may furnish, from the blood, some subtile
principle, such as that believed by M. Fontana,
to exist there, or such as that we are
now examining, which differently modified
in different parts, may be the latent cause
of all the phenomena exhibited by animals.</p>

<p class='c006' >The advocates for the first opinion observe,
that whenever the brain is considerably
injured, or its free communication, by
means of nerves, with moving parts is interrupted,
a deprivation both of sense and
motion is the uniform consequence: and,
further, that the several organs, both of sense
and of motion, appear to suffer detriment
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_105' id='Page_105'>105</a></span>
from the over strained exertions of the brain
in thinking, equal to that which they experience
from their own exertions.</p>

<p class='c006' >The second opinion is countenanced by
facts and observations not less important.
From experiments of Haller; some which
are recorded in one of the early volumes
of the Philosophical Transactions, and
others, it appears that a paralysis of the
posterior extremities of animals was induced
by tying their aorta.</p>

<p class='c006' >Both Dr Monro and Dr Alexander of Halifax
have remarked, that when all the blood
vessels, supplying the posterior extremities
of frogs, had been divided, and a solution
of opium injected under the skin of these
extremities, they became, in less than half
an hour, both motionless and insensible;
whereas, the fore part of the body was not
observably affected six hours afterwards;
and, in Dr Monro’s experiments, the frogs
lived till the day following. Hence Dr
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_106' id='Page_106'>106</a></span>
Monro concludes, ‘that concomitant arteries,
somehow or other, tune the nerves,
so as to fit them to convey impression<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c008'><sup>[13]</sup></a>.’</p>

<p class='c006' >On the other hand, where it is intended
that nerves shall convey impressions with
great accuracy, as in all the senses, and very
remarkably in the part which some have
amused themselves by considering as a sixth
organ of sense, the distribution of blood
vessels is more profuse than in almost any
other equal part. It is likewise universally
true, that increase of vascular action in a
part is always attended with a proportional
increase of sensibility there.</p>

<p class='c006' >From the valuable experiments made by
Mr Cruikshanks, and which have since received
the fullest confirmation from those
repeated by M. Fontana and others, it appears,
that whatever may be the relation
between brain and nerves, the latter may
certainly be regenerated after excision, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_107' id='Page_107'>107</a></span>
have their functions fully restored. Now,
in what manner this can be accomplished,
unless by the agency of arteries, would, I
imagine, be no easy task to point out.</p>

<p class='c006' >The influence discovered by Galvani appeared
to me an admirable test, by which
something decisive might be ascertained relative
to these important points in the physiology
of animals, and as such I have employed
it in the following experiments.</p>

<p class='c006' >Considering, therefore, the brain on the
one hand, and the sanguiferous system on
the other, as the possible sources from
which nerves and muscles might derive their
power, I began by comparing the effects
which result from interrupting their communication,
first with the brain, and then
with the arteries. This mode of procedure
seemed to afford the best prospect of information
with respect to every object which
I had in view, but particularly with regard
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_108' id='Page_108'>108</a></span>
to the relations which this influence may
bear to the several parts examined.</p>

<p class='c006' >Before relating the experiments, I must
observe that the comparison was instituted
between the effects of only partially interrupted
communication; since it must be obvious
that a complete interruption, either
of nervous or of arterious communication
between any part of an animal, and the rest
of its body, could not have been effected
without so far injuring the animal, as to
render the result fallacious.</p>

    <div>EXPERIMENT I.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_6 c006'     >I divided the sciatic nerve, on one side
only, in four large frogs. The division
was made at the very top of their thighs,
and before the nerve had given off the first
large branch to the muscles of the thigh.
This nerve lies immediately underneath
the large crural artery, to which it is closely
attached by a sheath of fine but very
strong cellular membrane. A small nerve,
which supplies some of the muscles on the
under side of the thigh, was suffered to remain
undivided. The legs, whose nerves
had been divided, became completely paralytic
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_110' id='Page_110'>110</a></span>
below the knee, and very nearly so
above it. These legs too, immediately after
the division of their nerves, contracted
vigorously when laid upon zinc, and excited
by passing a rod of silver in contact
with the under part of the knee till it touched
the zinc; but the other legs which were
suffered to remain in their natural state, in
order that the contractility of one leg might
all along be compared with that of the
other, did not contract when the metals
were similarly applied to them.</p>

<p class='c006' >These frogs were all killed by cutting off
their heads; the first, at the end of two
days after dividing the nerve; the second,
at the end of five days; the third, at the
end of seven; and the fourth, at the end
of nine. Their legs were carefully examined,
in the manner I have described,
four or five times every day after their
heads had been taken off, so long as any
contractions could be excited; but I could
not perceive, in any one of these instances,
that the contractile power continued either
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_111' id='Page_111'>111</a></span>
longer or more vigorous in the legs, in
which the nerves were not divided than it
did in those in which they were.</p>

<p class='c006' >Both in these experiments, and in all my
others, where a comparison was instituted
between the two legs of the same frog, I
divided equal portions of skin on both
thighs, that there might be no unequal exposure
of the muscles to the water, which
would have occasioned a fallacy in the result.</p>

EXPERIMENT II.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c006'     >On the 31st of March last, I divided, in
two, a frog, in one of whose legs I had
four months before excited inflammation,
by laying bare the crural artery and nerve.
The inflammation had been so violent and
general, that the frog lost its cuticle in consequence
of it, and, when compared with a
healthy frog, its resperation was observed
to be remarkably frequent. Three weeks
after this, when the wound in its thigh had
perfectly skinned over, I laid it open again,
and divided the sciatic nerve. No general
inflammation this time took place, nor did
the wound again skin over; but for about a
month before it was killed, a large ulcer had
formed immediately over the division of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_113' id='Page_113'>113</a></span>
nerve, but had not proceeded down to it.
The limb, at the time I killed the frog, was
as destitute both of motion and of sensation,
as at the first instant the nerve was divided,
but contractions were excited in it, by
touching the ulcer with zinc and silver.
When the frog was dead, however, the contractions
were found much more feeble in
this than in the other leg.</p>

<p class='c006' >The metals were now applied to the sciatic
nerves within the abdomen. Vigorous
contractions were excited in the sound leg,
but none in that whose nerve had been divided.
Hence it was plain, that no actual
regeneration had taken place. On examining
the nerve accurately at the part divided,
I found the divided ends, which had receded
considerably from each other, connected
by a transparent gelatinous substance.
From the upper end, which appeared elongated
into a conical form, several red streaks
projected into the interposed substance. The
lower end was opaque, thickened, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_114' id='Page_114'>114</a></span>
rounded. No appearance of spiral bands
could be detected, either in the interposed
substance, or in the part of the nerve below
the division, when these parts were examined
with the assistance of a microscope. This
substance had attained sufficient consistence
to support the under part of the nerve, when
the upper was raised with a pair of forceps.
The leg, in which the nerve had been divided,
continued to contract as long as the
other, though much less vigorously, and
the part, from which I could longest excite
contractions, was the ulcer.</p>

EXPERIMENT III.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c006'     >On the 14th of April last, I killed two
other frogs, by dividing their hind
extremities from their bodies. In one, the
right sciatic nerve had been divided more
than six weeks previous to its death. In
the other, one of the sciatic nerves had been
divided between three weeks and a month.</p>

<p class='c006' >The legs of these frogs, examined by the
metals both before and after their separation
from the body, were found in a state very
different from those before spoken of. The
contractions were scarcely perceptible. The
incisions made through the skin, in order
to get at their nerves, had closed completely
in less than a week after they had been
made.</p>

<p class='c006' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_116' id='Page_116'>116</a></span>
The appearance of the muscles in the
legs, whose nerves had been divided, was
found to be precisely the same as in those
where nothing had been done; but, notwithstanding
this circumstance, even strong
electrical sparks excited but very feeble contractions.
On examining the nerves, the
ends of that which had been longest divided
were found connected by a substance
not at all resembling nerve, but similar to
that found in the former experiment, and
evidently proceeding from the upper division.
In the nerve which had not been so
long divided, this circumstance was still
more apparent, as the substance had not extended
quite to the lower division. The
cellular membrane surrounding these upper
divisions had the appearance of innumerable
vessels finely injected, and some red streaks
were seen projecting, as if from the nerve
itself, into the gelatinous production. In
the sound nerves, the obliquely transverse
lines of alternate opacity and transparency,
or, as Fontana has called them, the white
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_117' id='Page_117'>117</a></span>
spiral bands of nerves, were seen distinctly
at the first glance of the eye, and without
the assistance of a glass; but no appearance
of these could be found in the parts of the
divided nerves below the division; these
were uniformly opaque. Their bulk, however,
was not in the least diminished. The
organization of nerves long divided, therefore,
undergoes a very evident alteration,
although it is by no means so clear that the
same change happens in the muscles, to
which these nerves are distributed. Yet
their susceptibility to the action of electricity,
as well as to that of this new influence,
was nearly lost. Some may consider this
as an additional argument, that stimuli act
upon muscles only through the medium of
nerves.</p>

<p class='c006' >I have before observed that muscles of
frogs, from whom the skin has been stripped,
become in a short time hard when exposed
to the action of water. Wishing,
therefore, to see if there would be any difference
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_118' id='Page_118'>118</a></span>
between these legs, whose nerves
had been divided, and others, in this respect,
I laid them in water, and examined them
every ten minutes, but both became hard
nearly at the same time. Mr Allen, a
gentleman well versed in physiological pursuits,
was with me when I examined the
alteration which had taken place in one of
these nerves, in consequence of its having
remained long divided, and I had afterwards
an opportunity of shewing it to Dr Rutherford.
In all the frogs, whose nerves
I have divided, I have observed that the
divided extremities, though placed in most
exact contact from each other, had after a
time receded at least 1/12 of an inch from
each other.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_6 c006'     >Both crural arteries of a full grown
frog having been laid bare, one of
them was tied. The leg, in which this was
done, became instantly weaker than the
other, and rather dragged when the animal
was put into water. The frog, however,
could still jump about with great agility.
Four hours after this operation, it was killed
by crushing its brain. It continued to
move its legs spontaneously, when touched,
during more than two days after this, and
contractions were excitable by the application
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_120' id='Page_120'>120</a></span>
of the metals for two days longer.
Sometimes it appeared rather doubtful,
which leg contracted most vigorously, but,
in general, the leg in which the artery remained
free did so, and contractions could
be excited in it, more than an hour after
every means to excite them in the other leg
had failed.</p>

EXPERIMENT II.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_8_0_6 c006'     >Ligatures were passed round the
crural arteries of two other frogs, and
one of them was suffered to live thirty six
hours afterwards, before its head was crushed:
the other four days. In these, the disproportion
between the vigour and continuance
of the contractions in the compared
legs, was so much greater than in the preceding
experiment, as to leave no doubt of
the effects produced by tying an artery.
The leg, whose artery had remained tied
four days, never contracted near so strongly
as its fellow, and contractions had ceased
to be excitable in it, upwards of twenty
hours before they had ceased in the leg,
whose artery had not been tied.</p>

<p class='c006' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_122' id='Page_122'>122</a></span>
From these experiments, it appears decidedly,
that a much greater detriment to
that condition of a limb, upon which contraction
depends, is induced by interrupting
its circulation, than by intercepting its communication
with the brain.</p>

<p class='c006' >But still, as the effects arising from the
interception of the influence of the brain, and
of the circulation, were not compared with
each other in the same but in different animals,
whose age, relative strength, &amp;c.
might possibly differ, I thought proper to
repeat the comparison, in the following
manner.</p>

strangled it. During the first 24 hours, the
leg, in which the nerve had been divided,

this circumstance, as it tends to prove that
the pain occasioned by the operation was
probably not so great as to produce much
fallacy.</p>

<p class='c006' >On the day following, she had spawned,
and on the sixth day from the operations,

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_6 c006'     >Having tied the crural artery on one
side, and divided the sciatic nerve on
the other, on three full grown male frogs,
I strangled them all on the sixth day following.
My motive for killing the frogs, subjected
to such experiments, either in this
manner or by crushing their heads, will be
obvious. It was of consequence to preserve
their circulation as entire as possible, and, at
the same time, avoid the continuance of
pain, which by exhausting all the parts of
the body, whose communication with the
brain was not interrupted, might considerably
have affected the result of the experiments.</p>

<p class='c006' >The contractions excited by means of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_127' id='Page_127'>127</a></span>
metals, were, in all these instances, likewise
as much more strong and durable in the
legs, whose nerves had been divided, than
what they were in the legs, whose arteries
had been tied, as what I had found them
to be in the preceding experiment.</p>

<p class='c006' >Having thus found, that a diminution
of the circulation of a part, was accompanied
with a proportionable diminution of
the respective powers of nerves and muscles
in that part, I next proceeded to examine
if an increased circulation would be attended
with a proportionable increase of these
powers. That this is actually the case, with
respect to the nerves, the few facts which
I have related of the eye, in a state of inflammation,
have a tendency to prove; and
we all know how much the sensibility of
every part of the body is increased, by an
increase of vascular action. That a similar
relation subsists between an increased action
of the arteries, and the contractile power of
muscles, is, I think, proved by the following
experiment.</p>

<p class='c006' >I have before said that if a living and entire
frog be set upon a plate of zinc,
contractions can very seldom be produced
in any part of its body by passing a rod of silver
over it, so that the silver, the frog, and
the zinc, may be all in contact with each other.
But, I have found in upwards of twenty
experiments, that when inflammation had
been excited in one of the hind legs of a
frog, by irritating it with a brush, contractions
uniformly took place in that leg when
the metals were applied to it, although
none had been produced in it before it was
inflamed, nor could still be produced in the
other leg which remained in its natural
state.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_6 c006'     >Having previously excited inflammation,
by means of a brush, in the foot
and leg of a healthy and large frog, I cut
off its head. The contractions excited by
the metals in the inflamed leg were in vigorous
and instantaneous jirks; those in
the sound leg more languid and difficultly
excited. Spontaneous motions continued
at this time nearly the same in both. Till
the end of the second day, after this frog’s
head had been taken off, the contractions
excited in the inflamed leg continued uniformly,
and beyond all comparison more
vigorous than what I could by any means
excite in the sound leg. But, after this
time, the inflamed leg became hard as a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_130' id='Page_130'>130</a></span>
piece of wood; probably in consequence of
the effusion to which the inflammation had
given rise.</p>

<p class='c006' >The event of five similar experiments was
so nearly the same, that I should be thought
unnecessarily minute, were I to relate them
in detail.</p>

<p class='c006' >We are now perhaps prepared to account
for the deficiency of contractile power in
those legs, whose sciatic nerves had been
divided, the one, between three weeks and
a month, the other, six weeks, compared
with its continuance in the leg, whose
nerve had been divided upwards of three
months. It appears, from the circumstances
of those experiments, that some of the arteries,
appropriated to the supply of the sciatic
nerves of frogs, have the same course
with the nerves themselves; since the deposition
of new matter could in all be traced
from the upper division of the nerves. It is
obvious, therefore, that the part of the nerves
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_131' id='Page_131'>131</a></span>
below the division, must have been deprived
of so considerable a portion of their usual
arterial supply, as in time would occasion
some alteration in their structure, and consequently
in their powers. We accordingly find
that such alteration of structure, and such
deficiency of power, had actually taken
place. It is further probable, that, in proportion
as the supply from the arteries was
restored, the powers of that nerve, which
had been three months divided, had been
likewise restored. This supposition is countenanced
by every instance in which nerves
are reproduced; as we find the functions of
the parts in which they had been divided,
are not immediately, but gradually restored.</p>

<p class='c006' >M. Fontana seems too hastily to have
adopted the opinion, that the sciatic nerves,
when divided, are probably never reunited
by truly nervous structure, because no reunion
took place during the very short period
which he suffered to elapse between
their division, and their subsequent examination.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_132' id='Page_132'>132</a></span>
In the experiments, which I have
related, the progress towards reunion seems
to have borne a very exact proportion to
the time the nerves had remained divided;
and, in an experiment related by Dr Monro,
where the sciatic nerve of a frog had been
divided a year previous to the death of the
animal, the reproduction was advanced so
far as to have the appearance of being perfect.
Nor can I doubt, that both the sensibility
and the motion of the limb would
have been restored, had the animal been
permitted to live a sufficient length of time.
The following fact renders the supposition
at least extremely probable.</p>

<p class='c006' >In the first volume of the Edinburgh
Medical Essays, the case of a Captain of a
man of war is related, who entirely lost the
use of his right arm, in consequence of a
gun-shot wound received in his neck. The
circumstances of the case are such as leave
no reason to doubt, that the loss of the
power of motion, in this gentleman’s arm,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_133' id='Page_133'>133</a></span>
was owing to the division of the cervical
nerves proceeding to the arm: yet both
the full use, and strength of this arm, were
restored, after a period of about two years
and a half. A proof perfectly satisfactory
that an actual regeneration of nerves had,
in this case, taken place; and if in this, one
sees no reason why it should not equally
take place in any other part of the body.</p>

<p class='c006' >It might be difficult to assign a satisfactory
reason for the very speedy reproduction
of the intercostal, parvagum, and recurrent
nerves, when compared with the
great length of time required for the reproduction
of others. May it not be owing
to the very profuse manner in which they
are supplied with arteries, probably both in
an ascending, and in a descending direction;
from above, by the superior, and
from below, by the inferior laryngeal arteries?</p>

<p class='c006' >It appears upon the whole, therefore, tolerably
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_134' id='Page_134'>134</a></span>
certain, that the sanguiferous system
contributes more immediately than the
brain to the support of that condition of
muscles and of nerves, upon which the phenomena
of contraction depend; since that
condition is much more injured by intercepting
the influence of the former than of
the latter.</p>

<p class='c006' >Every experiment and observation, which
has been made upon the subject of nutrition,
and of the reproduction of parts, clearly
demonstrates that nerves and muscles, in
common with every other part of the body,
derive their structure from the arteries; and
it is evident, that upon this structure their
several properties must in some measure depend.
But M. Galvani’s discovery of a
subtile influence, which may be transmitted
apparently from one part of an animal to
another through foreign media, may reasonably
give rise to a conjecture that the
phenomena exhibited by nerves and by
muscles may perhaps depend more immediately
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_135' id='Page_135'>135</a></span>
upon some such influence; and reasons
exist, which might induce some to
suspect that even this is derived from the
blood.</p>

<div>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_136' id='Page_136'>136</a></span>
<h3 class='c010'><i>Experiments suggested by some opinions of M. Fontana.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c011'     >From the greatest number of experiments,
perhaps, ever made by one physiologist,
M. Fontana has been led to conclude,
that the venom of the viper, opium,
and several other poisons, which he examined,
produce no effects whatever, when applied
immediately to nerves and muscles
alone, but that they destroy life, by exerting
their influence upon some subtile principle
existing in the blood.</p>

<p class='c006' >Independent of the experiments, published
by M. Fontana, on this subject, his opinion
respecting the existence of such a principle
may be thought to receive no inconsiderable
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_137' id='Page_137'>137</a></span>
countenance, from the opinions of
Harvey and of Mr Hunter, concerning the
life of the blood, and from those experiments,
by which Mr Hewson has demonstrated,
that changes are instantaneously produced
upon the coagulability of the blood,
by passions of the mind, and whatever else
affects the action of the heart and arteries.
An experiment made by Dr Alexander of
Halifax, and published at this place in the
year 1790, in his excellent Thesis, ‘De
partibus corporis quae viribus opii parent,’
may at first appear a sufficient refutation of
M. Fontana’s opinion.</p>

<p class='c006' >He found that thirty three drops of a
strong solution of opium in water, injected
into the jugular vein of a large rabbit, destroyed
it, as in M. Fontana’s experiments, in
four minutes and a half; whereas, the same
quantity injected into the crural vein in
each leg of another rabbit, with an interval
of twenty six minutes between the two
injections, although it rendered the animal
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_138' id='Page_138'>138</a></span>
sleepy and stupid for a few hours, did it no
material or permanent injury. Hence, Dr
Alexander concludes, that the opium, injected
into the jugular vein, did not destroy
the animal by acting upon the blood
alone, since if it had, the same effect, should
have been produced, by introducing an
equal quantity into any other vein of the
body; but a quantity double of that, which
had occasioned death when introduced into
the jugular vein, failed to occasion it when
introduced into the crurals.</p>

<p class='c006' >It is not, however, by one experiment,
formidable as it must be allowed to be, that
the innumerable hosts brought to the contest
by M. Fontana ought to be combated.
Besides, it might be objected even to this
one, that the opium was introduced into
veins, from which it must have been so
much longer in passing to the arterial blood,
than from the jugular vein, and consequently
so much more diluted, and perhaps too
altered in its nature before it got there, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_139' id='Page_139'>139</a></span>
might be sufficient to account for the difference
of result in the two cases compared.</p>

<p class='c006' >The opportunity afforded by M. Galvani’s
discovery, of putting the truth of the
opinion held by M. Fontana more fully to
the test, and the possibility which presented
itself, that if any such principle, as he
supposes in the blood, should really be
found to exist there, it might prove to be
identically the same with that discovered
by M. Galvani, induced me to make the
following experiments.</p>

EXPERIMENT I.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_6 c006'     >Having selected two frogs as nearly
as possible of the same size and vigour,
I deprived one of its blood by opening,
first, one of its crural veins, then, a crural
artery, and last of all, the heart. To
assure myself of the complete evacuation
of its blood, I next injected water into its
heart, and immediately afterwards forty
drops of a strong aqueous solution of
opium<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c008'><sup>[14]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c005' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_141' id='Page_141'>141</a></span>
I then removed the sternum of the other
frog, and having made an opening into
the ventricle of its heart, injected into it
likewise forty drops of the solution. Less
blood was effused in doing this, than one
would at first expect; for the ventricle contracts
so strongly, immediately after the
incision, as to prevent much blood from
passing out, unless the incision be made, as
it was in the other frog, purposely large.</p>

<p class='c006' >The moment, at which each injection
was made, was accurately noted, and the
time expended in evacuating the blood
from the first frog, was allowed for. The
frog, from which the blood had been withdrawn,
ceased to contract, when irritated,
very nearly an hour before the other, even
calculating not from the time of injection,
but from the moment I began to bleed it;
nor could I by means of the metals excite
contractions in it, for upwards of a day before
they had ceased to be excitable in the
other frog.</p>

EXPERIMENT II.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_5_0_6 c006'     >As evacuating the blood from a living
animal is rather a severe operation,
and might have occasioned some fallacy in
the last experiment, by subjecting the frog,
in which this was done, to a greater degree
of pain, and consequently of exhaustion,
than what the other was subjected to, I
crushed the brains of two other frogs before
I proceeded, as in the former experiment,
to withdraw the blood from one of them.
Instead of forty, I injected no more than
thirteen drops of the strong solution of
opium, into each of the hearts of these frogs.
The instant the injection had entered, both
hearts became white, and ceased from contracting.
Forty eight hours after the injection
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_143' id='Page_143'>143</a></span>
of the opium, the contractions excited
by the metals in the frog, deprived of its
blood, had become very slight, particularly
in the limb whose vein and artery had been
opened. The other frog still continued to
contract with so much vigour, as to raise
its body from the plate of zinc, upon which
it was laid. Seventy two hours after the
injection, no contractions could be excited
in the frog, from which the blood had been
withdrawn, except some very slight ones in
the leg, whose artery and vein had not been
opened. The contractions in the legs of
the other frog, continued still so vigorous
as to raise its body from the plate, and some
were produced even by mechanical irritation.</p>

<p class='c006' >Ninety six hours after the opium had
been injected, (both the frogs having lain
out of water all night,) that without blood
was found quite putrid. In the other, the
contractions, produced by exciting the legs,
were sufficiently strong to move the feet:
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_144' id='Page_144'>144</a></span>
as the body, however, had become putrid
and offensive, it was thrown away.</p>

    <div>EXPERIMENT III.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_6 c006'     >The heads of two other full grown
and lively frogs, having been crushed,
their hearts were laid bare, and the blood was
evacuated from one of them, as in the former
experiments. A small portion of the
skull of each then being removed, eight
drops of the strong solution of opium was
injected upon their brains. At least half
the quantity seemed to return from the
wound. Both frogs became instantaneously
motionless after the injection, but, in about
an hour, were considerably recovered.</p>

<p class='c006' >Spontaneous motions continued during
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_145' id='Page_145'>145</a></span>
more than fifty hours, in the legs of that
from which the blood had not been drawn,
and contractions were excitable by the metals,
upwards of 24 hours after they had
ceased to be so, in that from which the
blood had been drawn.</p>

<p class='c006' >The following experiments may be deemed
still more satisfactory, than the preceding,
from the circumstance of the comparison
having been instituted, between the effects
of opium, upon different, but similar
parts of the same frog, differently circumstanced.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_6 c006'     >One of the crural arteries of a frog
having been included in a tight ligature,
as near as possible to the body, I
suffered four days to elapse, and then injected
through a perforation in its skull, eight
drops of the strong solution upon its brain,
and in a direction towards its spinal marrow.
This frog continued most violently
convulsed for more than an hour, and, in
two, was to all appearance dead. When
laid upon zinc, and excited with silver, the
contractions were not at first perceptibly
stronger in one leg than in the other. After
eight hours, however, they were evidently
most strong in the leg whose artery
remained free. After 21 hours, this difference
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_147' id='Page_147'>147</a></span>
became still more decided. At the
end of 34 hours, scarcely any contractions
could be excited in the leg whose artery had
been tied; though they continued vigorous
in the other; and, at the end of 46 hours, they
had ceased altogether to be excitable, in the
leg whose artery was tied. In the other, they
continued during several hours afterwards.</p>

the metals, had become very feeble in the
leg whose artery was tied, in comparison
of what they were in the other leg; and, at
the end of twelve hours, no contractions
could be excited in any part of the frog, except
in the leg whose artery remained free.
In this they continued excitable about an

    <div>EXPERIMENT VIII.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_6 c006'     >I first divided the sciatic nerves, in both
legs of two frogs, and then tied the crural
artery in one leg of each. Eight drops
of the solution of opium were immediately
afterwards injected upon their brains. But
the event of this experiment was precisely
the same with the majority of those before
related. The contractions excited by the
metals, in the legs whose arteries were tied,
were uniformly more feeble, and of shorter
duration, than those excited in the other
legs: yet it is evident, that, in all these
experiments, the very reverse of this ought
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_151' id='Page_151'>151</a></span>
to have taken place, had it been true, as
M. Fontana has asserted, that opium has no
effect upon any part of the body, except
through the medium of the blood.</p>

<p class='c006' >The experiments however, which I am

satisfactory.</p>

    <div>EXPERIMENT IX.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_6 c006'     >Having laid equally bare both the
sciatic nerves of a frog, at the upper
part of its thighs, I passed a ligature round
one of them, and drew it as tight as it was
well possible, without dividing the nerve. I
then removed a portion of its skull, and with
a small brush, kept it constantly wet with
laudanum during several hours. The frog
soon became convulsed; and, during ten or
twelve hours, continued in that state of exquisite
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_152' id='Page_152'>152</a></span>
sensibility, which opium never fails
to produce in these animals. It may here
be worth remarking, that, while they are in
this state, the slightest touch of a feather, or
even breathing upon them, excites instantaneous
convulsions. The leg whose nerve
was tied, remained paralytic during this
time, but when it was laid upon zinc and
excited with silver, it contracted as strongly
as the other. After forty three hours,
the contractions were very feeble in the leg
whose nerve was not tied, but still vigorous
in the other. After fifty three hours, no
contractions could be excited in any part of
the frog, except in the leg whose nerve was
tied. In this they were sufficiently strong
to move the foot, and continued so for more
than an hour longer.</p>

<p class='c006' >The contractions, excited by the metals,
in the leg whose nerve was free, soon became
more feeble than those excited in the
leg, whose nerve had been tied. This disproportion,
between them, continued increasing
during ninety six hours, after the opium
had been injected, when contractions could
no longer be excited in the leg whose nerve
remained free. In that, in which the nerve
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_154' id='Page_154'>154</a></span>
had been tied, they continued upwards of
4 hours afterwards.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c001'   >
    <div>EXPERIMENT XI.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_6 c006'     >Immediately after having divided
the sciatic nerve, in one thigh only, of
three other frogs, I injected as much of the
strong solution of opium underneath their
skulls, as could possibly be retained. The
legs, in which the nerves had been divided,
continued contractile several hours after the
others had ceased to be so.</p>

<p class='c006' >Hence, then, we see no reason for suspecting
that the more speedy cessation of contractions
in those legs, in which the crural
arteries were tied, than in those on which
no operation was performed, was owing to
the pain occasioned by such operation, since
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_155' id='Page_155'>155</a></span>
even the more painful operations of tying
or dividing the sciatic nerves, were attended
with no such effect.</p>

<p class='c006' >Upon the whole, therefore, it appears,
that the conclusion which M. Fontana draws
from his numerous experiments with opium,
‘That the circulation of the blood and humours
in the animal machine, is the vehicle
for opium, and that, without this
circulation, it would have no action on the
living body,’ is the very reverse of that
which I am warranted to draw from the experiments
I have just related; since the parts,
most affected by the action of opium, were
not those in which the circulation remained
most entire, but those in which it had
been almost altogether interrupted; and since
in two parts where the circulation remained
equal, and entire, the action of opium was
rendered unequal, by interrupting the communication
of one of them, by means of
nerves, with the parts to which the opium
was applied.</p>

<p class='c006' >
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_156' id='Page_156'>156</a></span>
The existence, consequently, of any such
principle in the blood, as that supposed by
M. Fontana to exist there, is rendered far
too problematical, even to allow me to expect
that it can ever be proved: far less that
it may turn out to be the same with that
discovered by M. Galvani, or with that,
whatever it may be, upon which the phenomena
of nerves and of muscles may depend.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>APPENDIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_6 c005'     >I was unwilling to interrupt the narration
of the preceding experiments, by
the mention of the following facts, which
they afforded me an opportunity of observing,
as they were not immediately connected
with the objects on account of which
the experiments were instituted; and I have
yet some few to relate, which, from the
haste with which these sheets were prepared
for the press, I had omitted to insert in their
proper places.</p>

<p class='c006' >1. In one of my first experiments, in which
I had occasion to suffer a frog to remain tolerably
entire, so long as contractions could
be excited in any part of its body, I was
surprised to find, on removing its sternum,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_158' id='Page_158'>158</a></span>
that its heart had ceased to contract, nor
could be roused by the application of any
stimulus whatever, notwithstanding the contractions
in its hind legs, excited by the metals,
were still vigorous, and continued so
for several hours afterwards. On paying
particular attention to this circumstance in
another frog, upon whose brain opium had
been injected, I found that its legs continued
excitable, upwards of forty hours longer
than its heart. This discovery of the
continuance of the contractile power, in the
muscles of the posterior extremities, so
long after its disappearance in the heart, is
so contradictory to the opinion generally received
upon this subject, and long established
among physiologists, that I can scarcely
expect it should be credited, by those who
may not themselves have opportunities of
observing it. It is a fact, however, of which,
in the course of these experiments, I have
had the most satisfactory and uniform proofs,
both in such frogs as have, and in such as
have not, been under the influence of opium.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_159' id='Page_159'>159</a></span>
If a different opinion has hitherto been held
by experimentalists upon this subject, it
should be recollected, that, till the discovery
made by Galvani, we had no means of ascertaining
the presence of the contractile
power of muscles, which had not, at the
same time that they indicated its continuance,
a tendency to destroy it, and consequently
to render it impossible for us to trace
its natural progress to extinction.</p>

<p class='c006' >I have, more than once, observed the same
circumstance in both cats and rabbits.</p>

<p class='c006' >2. Dr Alexander, in his excellent Thesis
already quoted, tells us, that the contractility
of all the voluntary muscles of frogs
was destroyed in the course of a very few
minutes, by injecting eight drops of a strong
solution of opium in water, (similar to that
which I employed) upon the surfaces of
their brains. But that the contractions of
their hearts did not appear to be much, if at
all, affected by this treatment. In all the similar
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_160' id='Page_160'>160</a></span>
experiments, which I have made, the
event has been very different. I have not
found it possible by any quantity, either of
aqueous or of spirituous solution of opium,
injected upon the brains of frogs, to produce
that rapid extinction of the contractility
of their voluntary muscles, of which
Dr Alexander speaks. They commonly recovered
in less than an hour, from the complete
insensibility and paralysis, first occasioned
by the injection of the opium, and
after that time, their spontaneous motions
almost always continued for several hours
longer, and, by the application of the metals,
contractions were excitable even for days.
Their hearts, as I have already said, uniformly
lost their susceptibility of the action of
stimuli, long before their posterior extremities.</p>

<p class='c006' >3. The arguments against the antiquated
doctrine of transudation, through parts of
a living body, are already so numerous and
satisfactory, that it may be thought unnecessary
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_161' id='Page_161'>161</a></span>
to notice in this place, a decisive one
so far as relates to the skin of frogs, at least,
which may be deduced from the fact already
mentioned; that so long as the skin was suffered
to remain upon the limbs of frogs,
placing them in water, very evidently preserved
the contractility of their muscles,
whereas when the skin was taken off, the
muscles became hard, and incapable of contracting,
in a very few hours. Had there
been a possibility of water soaking through
the skin, this difference could not possibly
have had place.</p>

<p class='c006' >4. In speaking of some of the relations,
which subsist between the influence discovered
by Galvani and the nerves, I omitted
mentioning the following facts.</p>

<p class='c006' >A very different effect is produced by
applying the metals to the brain or spinal
marrow of frogs, from what is produced by
applying them to their nerves. In the latter
case, I have observed, that every muscle,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_162' id='Page_162'>162</a></span>
to which a nerve below the part touched is
distributed, is brought into instant contraction.
But no muscles are brought into contraction,
when the metals are applied to the
brain or spinal marrow, except such as derive
their nerves from the part immediately
in contact with the metals. The influence
does not stimulate or pass along the spinal
marrow, as it would along the trunk of a
nerve, to affect all other nerves branching
off from it.</p>

<p class='c006' >I first became acquainted with this fact,
while making the following experiment.
Having laid bare the brain of a living frog,
and put a stop to its spontaneous motions,
by gently pressing upon the brain, I introduced
a long slip of tin-foil doubled underneath
a part of the skull, which had not
been removed, and placed a silver probe
upon its tongue. The only muscles which
contracted, when the tin-foil was bent over
the nose of the frog, so as to come in contact
with the probe, were those which move
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_163' id='Page_163'>163</a></span>
the eyes, and the transparent membrane
which defends them, those of the tongue
and of the throat. When the tin-foil was
twisted into a thin roll, and passed a little
way down the spine, the muscles of the upper
extremities and of the thorax contracted;
when a little further, those of the back
and of the abdomen contracted; and when,
introduced still further, to where the sciatic
nerves leave the spine, the posterior extremities
were, for the first time, strongly convulsed.
I have repeated this experiment
very frequently; and have always found,
that, as soon as the spontaneous motions of
frogs had ceased, the contractions, excited
by the metals, were uniformly progressive
from the head downwards, corresponding
exactly to the progress of the metals down
the spine. The experiment sometimes succeeds
when neither the brain nor the spinal
marrow have been laid bare, and when
even the skin has not been divided, but,
when the frog is placed upon a plate of zinc,
and one of the ends of a bent silver wire is
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_164' id='Page_164'>164</a></span>
placed upon any part of its spine, while the
other is made to touch the plate.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c006' >5. As it has not been till very lately, that
I have been able to procure an electropherus,
I have as yet made but few experiments
with it; their result, however, is such
as tends still more to confirm me in the opinion,
that the influence, discovered by Galvani,
has no relation whatever to electricity.</p>

<p class='c006' >Having, first, so far freed the instrument,
from the small quantity of electricity collected,
by wiping it, that none was indicated
by a very sensible electrometer of linen-yarn,
suspended from the wooden part of its
handle; I placed it within a few inches of
a glass stand, upon which I had laid a plate
of zinc, supporting a frog recently killed,
and with its sciatic nerves within the abdomen
laid bare. A bar of zinc formed the
communication between the frog and the
metal plate of the electropherus. Contractions
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_165' id='Page_165'>165</a></span>
were then excited in the frog, by placing
one end of a bent silver wire, insulated
in sealing wax, upon the nerves of the frog,
and the other end upon the bar of zinc.
After strong contractions had, in this way,
been kept up for about half a minute, I
carefully removed the bar of zinc, by means
of a stick of wax, that there might be no
possibility of the electricity escaping, if any
should have been collected. The metal plate
was then raised from the varnished surface.
The electrometer attached to its handle was
very slightly affected; but a fine thread, presented
to the plate, was perceptibly attracted
by it.</p>

<p class='c006' >I had a strong suspicion, that the electricity,
thus collected, had been excited solely
by the friction of the frog’s legs during
contraction, against the insulated plate of
zinc upon which it lay; and I soon found
that my conjecture was just; for an equal
quantity of electricity was obtained from
another frog similarly disposed, when contractions
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_166' id='Page_166'>166</a></span>
were excited in it, by merely mechanical
irritation.</p>

<p class='c006' >The result was the same when these frogs
were laid successively upon the metal plate
of the electropherus itself, and excited, the
one in M. Galvani’s method, the other by
mechanical irritation only.</p>

<p class='c006' >These experiments were very frequently
repeated, but the quantity of electricity collected
was always greater where the contractions,
or, in other words, the friction
had been most considerable, and did not, in
any instance, appear to depend on the means
employed to excite the contractions.</p>

<p class='c006' >What still further proves, that the electricity,
in this way collected, had no dependence
whatever, for its production, upon
the application of the metals to the frog,
but had been merely the portion of electricity,
naturally possessed by the frog, in
common with other conducting substances,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_167' id='Page_167'>167</a></span>
is, that when the electricity, which was collected
from its first contractions, had been
drawn off from the plate, no more could
afterwards be collected, although the contractions,
excited by the metals, still continued
as vigorous as ever.</p>

<p class='c006' >6. When the electropherus was charged
with electricity, as highly as it was possible
to charge it by friction, the contractions
produced by the insulated metals in a prepared
frog, laid upon the metal plate of the
electropherus, were not at all affected by
raising it from the varnished surface. A
proof that the phenomena in question are
not affected, either by the condensation or
rarefaction of the electricity, in either the
animal or the metals, by which they are
exhibited.</p>

<p class='c006' >I have not found, that any quantity of
electricity, which I could accumulate in
the metal plate of the electropherus, did
ever, when discharged into the nerve of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_168' id='Page_168'>168</a></span>
frog, excite contractions nearly so strong as
what are excited by the application of zinc
and silver; nor could I, at any time, collect
a sufficient quantity of electricity, from five
insulated frogs, sufficient to excite contractions
in a single leg of a frog, though recently
separated from its body, and consequently
excitable by stimuli of very weak
powers.</p>

Robison, Professor of Natural Philosophy

<div class='c015'><span class='sc'>Edin.</span> <i>May 28. 1793.</i></div>
<p class='c016' >SIR,</p>

<p class='c017' >About a fortnight ago, my son told
me of a curious experiment, with a piece
of zinc and a piece of silver applied to the
tongue, by which a strong irritation, resembling
taste, was produced, and that a
luminous flash was excited, by applying one
of them to the eye. I immediately repeated
them according to his directions, and
my curiosity was greatly excited to prosecute
them in a variety of circumstances. I
understand, that these experiments have originated
from the curious discoveries made
some time ago in Italy, of which I was informed
last winter. But I have been so
much out of the world for some years past,
that I have had no opportunity of knowing
what was going forward.</p>

<p class='c017' >Being informed, that you have been long engaged
in experiments on this subject, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_170' id='Page_170'>170</a></span>
are about to favour the public with an account
of them, I have taken the liberty of
communicating to you, a few facts which
have occurred to me, some of which, perhaps,
may be new to you.</p>

<p class='c017' >1. I find, that if a piece of zinc be applied
to the tongue, and be in contact with
a piece of silver, which touches any part of
the lining of the mouth, nostrils, ear, urethra,
or anus, the sensation resembling taste
is felt on the tongue. If the experiment
be inverted, by applying the silver to the
tongue, the irritation produced by the zinc
is not sensible, except in the mouth and
the urethra, and is very slight. I find
the irritation by the zinc strongest when the
contact is very slight, and confined to a narrow
space, and when the contact of the silver
is very extensive, as when the tongue
is applied to the cavity of a silver spoon.
When the zinc touches in an extensive surface,
the irritation produced by a narrow
contact of the silver is very distinct, especially
on the upper side of the tongue, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_171' id='Page_171'>171</a></span>
along its margin. This irritation seems to
be mere pungency, without any resemblance
to taste, and it leaves a lasting impression,
like that made by caustic alcali.</p>

<p class='c017' >2. If the zinc (finely polished) be applied
to the ball of the eye, the brightness of the
flash seems to correspond with the surface of
contact, of the silver with the tongue,
palate, fauces or cheek. The same thing
happens when the silver is applied to the
eye.</p>

<p class='c017' >3. When a rod of zinc, and one of silver
are applied to the roof of the mouth, as far
back as possible, the irritations produced, by
bringing their outer ends into contact, are
very strong, and that by the zinc resembles
taste, in the same manner as when applied
to the tongue.</p>

<p class='c017' >4. I had been paring my toe nails with
scizzars, and had cut off a considerable portion
of the thick skin, so that the blood began
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_172' id='Page_172'>172</a></span>
to <i>ooze</i> through, in the middle of the
wound. I applied the zinc there, and an extensive
surface of silver to the tongue. Every
time I brought the metals into contact, I
felt a very smart irritation by the zinc at the
wound.</p>

<p class='c017' >5. I made a piece of zinc having a sharp
point, projecting laterally from its end. I
applied this point to a hole in a tooth, which
has sometimes ached a little, and applied the
silver in an extensive surface to the inside of
the cheek. When the metals were brought
into contact, I felt a very smart and painful
twitch in the tooth, perfectly resembling a
twitch of the toothack. I thought this
twitch double, and that one of them happened
before the metals came into absolute
contact. I am now almost convinced, that
this is the case, for when I make the silver
rest on a dry tooth, without touching
the tongue or fauces, I have no twitch on
bringing the outer ends of the metals together:
showing that there is not a proper
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_173' id='Page_173'>173</a></span>
communication through a dry tooth. If,
while the outer ends remain in contact, I
touch the silver with the tip of the tongue,
still no twitch is felt in the tooth. If I now
separate the outer ends of the metals, keeping
the tongue applied to the silver, a slight
twitch is felt in the moment of separation,
and a strong double twitch when they are
again brought into contact. N. B. This
twitch is prevented, by allowing the tongue
or lip to touch any part of the zinc.</p>

<p class='c017' >6. I had a number of pieces of zinc made
of the size of a shilling, and made them up
into a rouleau, with as many shillings. I find
that this alternation, in some circumstances,
increases considerably the irritation, and expect,
on some such principle, to produce a
still greater increase. If the side of the rouleau
be applied to the tongue, so that all the
pieces are touched by it, the irritation is
very strong and disagreeable. This explains
what I have often observed, the strong taste
of soldered seams of metal. I can now perceive
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_174' id='Page_174'>174</a></span>
seams in brass and copper vessels by the
tongue, which the eye cannot discover, and
can distinguish the base mixtures which
abound in gold and silver trinkets.</p>

<p class='c017' >If any of the above facts can add to the
stock of knowledge you have acquired on
this subject, it will give me great satisfaction,
and I shall not fail to communicate
any thing which may afterwards occur.
My indisposition hinders me from taking
an active part in the researches, to which
this wonderful and important discovery incites;
but it is both my duty and my earnest
wish, to contribute my feeble assistance
to every gentleman engaged in this interesting
pursuit.</p>

<p class='c017' >I find that common silver thread makes
a very good conductor, and this to any distance.</p>

<p class='c017' >Since writing the above, I have found a
very easy way of producing very sensible
convulsions, (I think muscular) and corroborating
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_175' id='Page_175'>175</a></span>
my opinion, that the communication
(of this part of the whole effect) takes
place before contact.</p>

<p class='c017' >Put a plate of zinc into one cheek, and
a plate of silver, (a crown piece) into the
other, at a little distance from each. Apply
the cheeks to them as extensively as possible.
Thrust in a rod of zinc between the zinc
and the cheek, and a rod of silver between
the silver and the other cheek. Bring their
outer ends slowly into contact, and a smart
convulsive twitch will be felt in the parts of
the gums situated between them, accompanied
by bright flashes in the eyes. And
these will be distinctly perceived before contact,
and a second time on separating the
ends of the rods, or when they have again
attained what may be called the striking
distance. If the rods be alternated, no effect
whatever is produced.</p>

<p class='c017' >Care must be taken, not to press the
pieces hard to the gums; this either hinders
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_176' id='Page_176'>176</a></span>
us from perceiving the convulsion, or prevents
it. I find too, that one rod, whether
zinc or silver, is sufficient for the communication,
and even bringing the two pieces
together, will do as well, or perhaps better.
But the rods are easier in the management.</p>

<p class='c017' >Asking pardon for the liberty I have taken,
without having the honour of your acquaintance,
I am,</p>

<p class='c016' >With great regard,</p>

<p class='c018' >SIR,</p>
